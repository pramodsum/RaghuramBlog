    "body": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We interact with the help of <span> </span>our indriyas, senses in this world for the sake of <span> </span>nourishing. What we see is for nourishing what we hear is for our nourishment and definitely what we eat is also for the sake of nourishment. If we take the topic of nourishing by eating it is a very elaborate topic. <span> </span>One aspect o f it is how we eat. Do we eat with hands or do we use cutlery?</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Predominantly in India and especially in south India and religiously in vegetarian places and homes most of the people eat with hands. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Eating with hands is non hygienic is not a very sound argument because invariably people wash their hands thoroughly before sitting for food. There are no evidences that people who eat with hands fall sick more frequently than those who attach food with instruments. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Especially in south Indian culture the food consists of one main item which is rice or roti<span>  </span>or puri etc and there are other items to go with that, which are cooked or fired vegetables, gravy vegetables followed by sambar and rasam and final course of rice with curds. after mixing these things in order to soften the spices in the curries ghee or oil is added according to ones <span> </span>taste. Adults and those who can handle extra spices to enhance the spices or to give special flavours we also have various powders and chatnis and pickles. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This very elaborate system needs a means to mix thoroughly several items in between our eating and with cutlery we cannot achieve it. In fact in my travel all over the world one thing that I noticed is that nowhere else in the world this practice of mixing few things is practiced. When I happened to go to china in the restaurant when we ordered boiled vegetables and rice, the server brings us the vegetables and is waiting for us to finish it so that he can bring in the rice. The service is also in bowls where there is no possibility to mix items! The practice of putting two things together and eating that is available in other cultures is to smear butter or jam onto the bread slice and eat. That is the reason in that cultures they developed using the knife which is convenient. Therefore for eating Indian food we have to use hands so that we can mix them evenly and eat! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Let me now talk about a very fascinating subject the spices. First thing is spices are all vegetable products. Any non-vegetarian food item, any meat or any animal product tastes only salt! It acquires different tastes by adding different spices. In ancient times spices are exported from India to Middle East and Europe and other parts of the world. In Turkey the name of the spices is ‘Bharat’.<span>   </span><span> </span>Indian culture developed an elaborate practice of vegetarian food. Just to give a small example in a dosa place in Bengaluru we have one hundred verities of dosa. That shows the amount of research and invention went into the cooking. If you take red chilli or black pepper or ginger they all have one word for their taste in English called hot! But if we notice there are certain hot stuff which you feel hot when you touch it to the tongue. Some of them create that irritation in the throat. Some others you don’t feel at all while you eat but when it goes into stomach there you feel burning sensation.<span>  </span>Similarly there are certain material which give aroma as it is but some other materials</span> <span>which give aroma and taste when you grind them dry. But some other stuff you cook and eat them as it is that will not give the aroma but some other stuff when you mix them thoroughly then it releases! Simple example is, when you put rasam on rice and mix it the aroma it offers is so different which you will certainly not get if you cook putting all ingredients together.<span>  </span>When you have coriander laves unless you smash them with hands while eating you do not get the smell but the curry leaves just being there in the dish gives the aroma! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Dr Christoph Garner a chief medical director of a hospital in Germany says that he always uses living fork for eating which is his fingers. It is a sight to see everyone in their family his wife and his three daughters two of them are also into medicine all of them eat with the living and flexible forks! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Food is not only for the taste buds on tongue or for the stomach alone. Different glands in us respond differently with different aroma. Your whole personality should assimilate food! First of all when you see the food certain response takes place within and when you are mixing the food you are facilitating the aroma to be released and our glands get activated. Mixing takes some time gap before you put the food in the mouth. That gap of time while mixing and the aroma released while mixing and smashing with hands will allow the necessary interval for your body to prepare to receive the food. Food is to be assimilated by the whole body! In addition to the aroma, seeing the food and touching and feeling the food <span> </span>give some amount of satiation</span> <span>removing the excitement part of eating so that when we eat food we don’t over load!<span>  </span>It is therefore said food belongs to hunger and not for excitement for eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One more aspect of food which helps us to nourish is the touch of the food. When you are touching the food its consistency already sends message to our inner organs those receive this food. First of all, hand finds out the temperature of the food so that mouth is not surprised when you feed. By touching, we also recognise the consistency. The touch and sight when they find something not matching with the colour and consistency immediately you will check before you eat. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>My grandmother always used to say that food is not just for eating but you should also feel the food. That is the reason I suppose in earlier days my grandmother used make the child sit on the ground, put a big plate in front of him, and put freely grains of cooked rice and ghee and some nice boiled soft vegetable pieces. Children use their tender hands and fingers to pick up the grains and try to put in mouth and in the process smear the food all over the body. They would have enjoyed food on their faces, in their hands and everywhere and also would have also dropped around. We would watch with joy how much the child is enjoying the feel of food. After all that the child is given a nice bath! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When you are able to get the nice feeling of satisfaction in mixing and feeling the food it automatically brings about slowness in eating. In addition you also observe and while eating, look at the mechanism that happens. You put food in the mouth while you are chewing you are not waiting. You are mixing and feeling the food and this time gap gives you opportunity to chew the food thoroughly mixing with sufficient amount of saliva which does not happen if you load your mouth fast with a spoon. We have to remind repeatedly to chew the food and it is good for health!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Though it is a little different context I would like to recollect an incident connected with Tagore. Robindranath Tagore went to England at a very early age. After years of learning and completing his studies he was returning to India for the first time. As soon as he got down from the ship he removed his shoes and socks and enjoyed the touch of the soil and feel of the soil with his feel and that was not sufficient he even rolled on the soil while everybody was looking at him surprised. That is the great feeling of satisfaction touching sensation gives us!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Similarly the touch of the food also brings about subtle satisfaction. That may be the reason many cooks, who cook in Bengaluru for special occasions are thin and lean even though they have plenty of freedom and opportunity to eat every day! They say that they enjoy the cooking so much that they don’t have to eat lot. Those who feel the food or enjoy mixing food with their fingers and enjoying the aroma get their satisfaction partially fulfilled by these activities and only for the rest of the satisfaction they get it by eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In Upanishads it is said that this body is made up of food. Food is the mother of our body and if we touch the food with that feeling we feel so satisfied and feel nourished. We therefore call food as mother goddess and we offer a prayer annapurne sada purne etc&hellip; <span> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The food that we respect we don’t want to abuse misuse or throw away and waste! The energy which is given by that food which is sanctified by this sacred feeling, how can we use that energy for wrong purposes! Our eating is therefore an offering to god and lLet our eating therefore <span> </span>add goodness in us!!!</span></p>",

There are no evidences that people who eat with hands fall sick more frequently than those who attach food with instruments. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Especially in south Indian culture the food consists of one main item which is rice or roti<span>  </span>or puri etc and there are other items to go with that, which are cooked or fired vegetables, gravy vegetables followed by sambar and rasam and final course of rice with curds. after mixing these things in order to soften the spices in the curries ghee or oil is added according to ones <span> </span>taste. Adults and those who can handle extra spices to enhance the spices or to give special flavours we also have various powders and chatnis and pickles. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This very elaborate system needs a means to mix thoroughly several items in between our eating and with cutlery we cannot achieve it. In fact in my travel all over the world one thing that I noticed is that nowhere else in the world this practice of mixing few things is practiced. When I happened to go to china in the restaurant when we ordered boiled vegetables and rice, the server brings us the vegetables and is waiting for us to finish it so that he can bring in the rice. The service is also in bowls where there is no possibility to mix items! The practice of putting two things together and eating that is available in other cultures is to smear butter or jam onto the bread slice and eat. That is the reason in that cultures they developed using the knife which is convenient. Therefore for eating Indian food we have to use hands so that we can mix them evenly and eat! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Let me now talk about a very fascinating subject the spices. First thing is spices are all vegetable products. Any non-vegetarian food item, any meat or any animal product tastes only salt! It acquires different tastes by adding different spices. In ancient times spices are exported from India to Middle East and Europe and other parts of the world. In Turkey the name of the spices is ‘Bharat’.<span>   </span><span> </span>Indian culture developed an elaborate practice of vegetarian food. Just to give a small example in a dosa place in Bengaluru we have one hundred verities of dosa. That shows the amount of research and invention went into the cooking. If you take red chilli or black pepper or ginger they all have one word for their taste in English called hot! But if we notice there are certain hot stuff which you feel hot when you touch it to the tongue. Some of them create that irritation in the throat. Some others you don’t feel at all while you eat but when it goes into stomach there you feel burning sensation.<span>  </span>Similarly there are certain material which give aroma as it is but some other materials</span> <span>which give aroma and taste when you grind them dry. But some other stuff you cook and eat them as it is that will not give the aroma but some other stuff when you mix them thoroughly then it releases! Simple example is, when you put rasam on rice and mix it the aroma it offers is so different which you will certainly not get if you cook putting all ingredients together.<span>  </span>When you have coriander laves unless you smash them with hands while eating you do not get the smell but the curry leaves just being there in the dish gives the aroma! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Dr Christoph Garner a chief medical director of a hospital in Germany says that he always uses living fork for eating which is his fingers. It is a sight to see everyone in their family his wife and his three daughters two of them are also into medicine all of them eat with the living and flexible forks! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Food is not only for the taste buds on tongue or for the stomach alone. Different glands in us respond differently with different aroma. Your whole personality should assimilate food! First of all when you see the food certain response takes place within and when you are mixing the food you are facilitating the aroma to be released and our glands get activated. Mixing takes some time gap before you put the food in the mouth. That gap of time while mixing and the aroma released while mixing and smashing with hands will allow the necessary interval for your body to prepare to receive the food. Food is to be assimilated by the whole body! In addition to the aroma, seeing the food and touching and feeling the food <span> </span>give some amount of satiation</span> <span>removing the excitement part of eating so that when we eat food we don’t over load!<span>  </span>It is therefore said food belongs to hunger and not for excitement for eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One more aspect of food which helps us to nourish is the touch of the food. When you are touching the food its consistency already sends message to our inner organs those receive this food. First of all, hand finds out the temperature of the food so that mouth is not surprised when you feed. By touching, we also recognise the consistency. The touch and sight when they find something not matching with the colour and consistency immediately you will check before you eat. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>My grandmother always used to say that food is not just for eating but you should also feel the food. That is the reason I suppose in earlier days my grandmother used make the child sit on the ground, put a big plate in front of him, and put freely grains of cooked rice and ghee and some nice boiled soft vegetable pieces. Children use their tender hands and fingers to pick up the grains and try to put in mouth and in the process smear the food all over the body. They would have enjoyed food on their faces, in their hands and everywhere and also would have also dropped around. We would watch with joy how much the child is enjoying the feel of food. After all that the child is given a nice bath! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When you are able to get the nice feeling of satisfaction in mixing and feeling the food it automatically brings about slowness in eating. In addition you also observe and while eating, look at the mechanism that happens. You put food in the mouth while you are chewing you are not waiting. You are mixing and feeling the food and this time gap gives you opportunity to chew the food thoroughly mixing with sufficient amount of saliva which does not happen if you load your mouth fast with a spoon. We have to remind repeatedly to chew the food and it is good for health!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Though it is a little different context I would like to recollect an incident connected with Tagore. Robindranath Tagore went to England at a very early age. After years of learning and completing his studies he was returning to India for the first time. As soon as he got down from the ship he removed his shoes and socks and enjoyed the touch of the soil and feel of the soil with his feel and that was not sufficient he even rolled on the soil while everybody was looking at him surprised. That is the great feeling of satisfaction touching sensation gives us!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Similarly the touch of the food also brings about subtle satisfaction. That may be the reason many cooks, who cook in Bengaluru for special occasions are thin and lean even though they have plenty of freedom and opportunity to eat every day! They say that they enjoy the cooking so much that they don’t have to eat lot. Those who feel the food or enjoy mixing food with their fingers and enjoying the aroma get their satisfaction partially fulfilled by these activities and only for the rest of the satisfaction they get it by eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In Upanishads it is said that this body is made up of food. Food is the mother of our body and if we touch the food with that feeling we feel so satisfied and feel nourished. We therefore call food as mother goddess and we offer a prayer annapurne sada purne etc… <span> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The food that we respect we don’t want to abuse misuse or throw away and waste! The energy which is given by that food which is sanctified by this sacred feeling, how can we use that energy for wrong purposes! Our eating is therefore an offering to god and lLet our eating therefore <span> </span>add goodness in us!!!</span></p>",

    "body": "<p><span>SUMMARY:  <em>yoga offers both philosophy and methods of practice. Though some schools may argue that how can  the ultimate state of peace and tranquillity the state of Purusha, be the outcome of any doing and if it is so when we are not doing we may lose it. Therefore it should not be product of any doing. What is really required is to realise.  Sage Patanjali rightly says that we are into habit formation of identifying with non self and we need to reverse it so that what habits are not us and we are wrongly identified with, we need to consciously come out of it.</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are two methods. One is the method of discipline called ‘Abhyasa’ and the other is the method of non-attachment, ‘vairagya’. </p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Human beings can be divided into two categories according to their psychology and they are extrovert and those who are introvert. Broadly speaking Abhyasa is the type of practices which will be cherished by extravert personalities and Vairagya techniques go well with introvert personalities. But another interesting observation is that no one is purely introvert or extrovert but there can be a dominance of one over the other. Therefore both the types of practices have to go hand in hand. According to one’s own nature one of them will take the priority. In addition we also do not stay at all times in one type of personality. Therefore what type works for us at one time may not work at other time period. Therefore the practice of yoga cannot be regimented for all and also cannot be rigid for one all the times. </span></em></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Mind itself is only an instrument like our hands legs, or eyes and ears. There is nothing good or bad in itself. Like the functioning of eyes is in the form of seeing, same way the functioning of the mind is in the form of thinking. Since it is a very useful tool for us to interact with the material outside in general, the tendency is to get lost in mind itself. In this process we forget that our being is beyond this mind and its activity. Patanjali gives this process of going beyond mind as yoga. Vruttis are the modifications of the mind and to stop and go beyond is the process which will take us to our real nature <em>[swaroopa]</em>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Yogah chitta vrutti nirodhah            Tatha drastuh Swaroope avastanam</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>&hellip;.</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Abhyasa vairagyabhyam tannirodhah</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This can be done according to Patanjali in two ways one is Abhyasa and the other Vairagya, roughly translated it is method of discipline and the other method of non- attachment or ‘let-go’. Let us see how these terms are having mistaken notion and how useful they are when we rightly understand these concepts for the benefit of the spiritual sadhaka.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>DISCIPLINE: the moment we think of discipline there are two positions available. One is the position that one is ‘under discipline’ and the other one who is ‘disciplining’. Psychologically one comes to a hasty conclusion of identifying with the one who is under discipline. This may be because while the child is growing up he or she only keeps hearing others saying constantly do this and don’t do this,  like receiving orders all the time. Same way when yoga gives dos and don’ts this is taken as imposing. When one takes the position of being under discipline it is immediately translated as curtailing your freedom and as a result of it, however useful it may be one would like to come out of discipline at the earliest ,</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In our residential therapy facility Prashanti, on the last day of their stay participants come to me to express their gratitude and say, ‘this is a wonderful place and we never knew that yoga has so many components, the practices are wonderful, the therapists are like angels and food is good the discipline of getting up early morning and working for the whole day is so helpful and Dr Nagarathna is like god and I would like to recommend all our family members who need a good therapy to come for treatment here.  Finally they ask “Raghuramji, I have one question for you”. I ask them what it is. The question is, “How long should I continue to do yoga?” I wonder if they found yoga to be so useful then why this question of how long to do yoga arises! It is so because they have taken the program at our centre as discipline imposed from outside and not as a discipline coming from within.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In reality we don’t need any discipline from outside. As it is, since we are part of the nature, we are disciplined. In the nature everything is in discipline. Ants walk one behind the other in discipline. Birds in the sky fly in discipline in nice formations. Every cocoanut tree has similar leaves in the form of discipline anywhere in the world and we can recognise it to be cocoanut tree from distance! You can find discipline everywhere in the nature. Birds wakeup in the morning at the same time in a disciplined way that is why we have birds voice for the clocks! The same way you can find natural discipline in the children they are hungry at the same time every day they go to sleep at the same time every day. Their pattern does not depend upon whether it is week day or week-end. We also used to have this discipline when we were children. But as we grew up we have come out of discipline. Therefore lack of discipline is an imposed habit but the discipline is part of our nature! When Patanjali says to discipline, it is not to impose discipline on us but to remove the indiscipline which unconsciously we acquired on us. We don’t have to feel we are slaves under discipline. But we are the masters who are disciplining the unruly forces which work as tendencies to take us away from discipline. Discipline has some other qualities too. Discipline is strength. See the crowd of people in a market place moving around without any discipline in different directions. They appear like crowd. The same crowd put them in rank and file and make them march for a disciplined footsteps in the form of an army that shows immediately the strength of the army. Discipline is also beautiful. When we plant the crops in nice lines stretching for miles you can feel that beauty of such agriculture fields. When the birds are flying in formation on the sky in discipline that beauty has filled Sri Ramakrishna with ecstasy! On the other hand a discipline which is forced from outside however useful may be we feel it as pressure where as the discipline coming from within, can work as tonic and transform a caterpillar into a butter-fly giving a freedom to fly, a bud into a beautiful flower spreading the fragrance.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Therefore, one final word in this regard is that the discipline has to come from within and not with imposed feeling. It is also researched that in the society where discipline is introduced culturally, such society is stronger psychologically and the people in that society suffer less psychological problems such as anxiety and depressions compared to the society where this discipline is not there.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VAIRAGYA NON-ATTACHEMNT:</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The other category of yoga practices according to Sage Patanjali is the non attachment. Whenever we say Vairagya in the name of yoga immediately in many minds and hearts fear and anxiety comes up as if you have to be prepared to give up everything and run away from the material world in to forest. If we closely watch, the idea of Non attachment is also something which is part of the nature. We only need to look at this as the river flowing. River can only be flowing because it continuously letting the water to flow. If this flow is stopped then the water will be stinking and loses its freshness. In the fall trees shed their leaves so that they are prepared to invite and embrace spring with fresh leaves! Life is a flow like a flame of fire. Unless until the old flows, new cannot come and freshness cannot be established. It is our sense of insecurity which makes us not to realise this. It is all due to ignorance that we hold onto no change. We give up something so that we provide room for something new to come in. We have been holding on to vruttis or the modifications in our mind which constantly torment us.  These modifications solidify so much that they don’t appear any more as modifications but as concrete objects. We don’t see them as vruttis any more but we see them as objects. Object itself does not hold on to us. It is the attachment for the object which holds onto us. Like a person who is a non smoker going through a new place does not notice any cigarette shop and one who is a smoker, at once notices every cigarette shop on the way! Once we have attachment for the object then we can notice all our thoughts angers and frustrations are around that object. If only we don’t have attachment for that objects all those fall off. The object itself is not holding on to us but we are holding on to the object. A home will not hold onto you. If you forget to lock the home when you are going to the work the home will not express its insecurity. It is our mind which suddenly remembers that we have forgotten to lock the home becomes panic. If we can develop nonattachment, we can be free from the worry of it. We also need to recognise that non attachment does not make us non functional. We are fully functional, and where ever necessary, we function not like slaves but like masters. One thing that develops with this wisdom is that the number of things we constantly desire will fall off. The reason for us to develop attachment is that we feel without that object we are incomplete and insecure and that object is absolutely necessary for us to be at the least in a normal state. Wisdom is that we are full <em>[Purna]. </em> Our involvement in to this world is not our lacking but we can involve making this world a better place. Without this attitude if we try to give up we are filled with frustration and feeling of loss. In addition we become cynical about others who are involved in the objective world. Every child in the childhood attached to pebbles from the sea shore. But once he becomes an adult he outgrows it very naturally. Same way when yoga says to practice non attachment, it is only suggesting us to grow out of it so that we can be part of the better world or inner world. It is a technique ro give a paradigm shift to out being.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Both these paths are not new to us we are already doing them. We are learning several things. All this learning if you see is nothing but we are disciplining our body. A child does not have any control over his hands. But we make the child to do continuous practice of writing and the child develops. We have techniques to train hands, legs, voice etc but we have no technique to train our mind towards being calm. This technique of yoga therefore is a unique technique wherein we consciously train our mind to become quite and still, and enable us to transcend our mind in calmness. This way we can go beyond mind to an experience of self.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            On the other hand we are unconsciously disconnecting our mind from the object. This we do every night by disconnecting our mind from the objective world. When we go to bed wanting to go to sleep, several thoughts, important ideas keep coming to us. But we say enough for all that and we go to bed. This is possible because temporarily we have detached from the material world things to attend etc. But we could temporarily say no to all of them and go to sleep! This is Vairagya and if we cannot do this Vairagya we cannot go to sleep.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Though the techniques are different, and the methodologies are different, the goal of both of them is the same that is the freedom and mastery.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            People with extrovert tendencies by nature have to do something visible a mere clarification is not sufficient. They have to feel the experience of the change. Therefore method of discipline belongs to the people with extravert tendencies. These techniques are visible from outside. A practice of pranayama or meditation, doing some japa or kriya practice, are visible and one can record that he has done so many hours of sadhana. Without such proof he may not feel the confidence that the idea has entered his heart! Therefore an extravert person can enjoy and be benefited by these techniques. On the other hand an introvert person looks at the process of letting go from within. The moment he knows that he should not be holding on to unnecessary mental processes and that is tormenting him he applies that principle repeatedly and be transformed within. He is not so much interested in having to do something outside. Thus the second set is the practices for him.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            An example for an introvert person is a professor who is a researcher and thinker. Once in America they wanted everyone to go through military training which included this professor also. The leader of the group was giving instructions right, left, about turn&hellip;. the professor stopped mid way. When the leader asked him, “Professor, why don’t you follow the team”, the professor replied first of all decide finally which way to go then I will go. </span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Mulla Nasruddin is a good example for extrovert! He is illiterate and his wife wrote to him a love letter. When the postman delivered that letter to him, Mulla asked him to read it for him. The postman replied with a smile Miya [friend], this is a love letter from your wife and how can i read it. Mulla gave him a suggestion, “you read it loud for me and I will close your ears so that you don’t hear it”!</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            We are all not purely introvert or extrovert. We have both of them and one may be dominating over the other. That is the reason Sage Patanjali suggests that both have to go hand in hand. Techniques of Abhyasa and Vairagya have to be judiciously adapted so that whenever we are having introvert nature dominance we do the Vairagya techniques and when extrovert dominance is there we do abhyasa practices. Ultimately our journey has to be progressing.</span></div>",

Every cocoanut tree has similar leaves in the form of discipline anywhere in the world and we can recognise it to be cocoanut tree from distance!&nbsp;You can find discipline everywhere in the nature. Birds wakeup in the morning at the same time in a disciplined way that is why we have birds voice for the clocks! The same way you can find natural discipline in the children they are hungry at the same time every day they go to sleep at the same time every day. Their pattern does not depend upon whether it is week day or week-end. We also used to have this discipline when we were children. But as we grew up we have come out of discipline. Therefore lack of discipline is an imposed habit but the discipline is part of our nature! When Patanjali says to discipline, it is not to impose discipline on us but to remove the indiscipline which unconsciously we acquired on us. We don&rsquo;t have to feel we are slaves under discipline. But we are the masters who are disciplining the unruly forces which work as tendencies to take us away from discipline. Discipline has some other qualities too. Discipline is strength. See the crowd of people in a market place moving around without any discipline in different directions. They appear like crowd. The same crowd put them in rank and file and make them march for a disciplined footsteps in the form of an army that shows immediately the strength of the army. Discipline is also beautiful. When we plant the crops in nice lines stretching for miles you can feel that beauty of such agriculture fields. When the birds are flying in formation on the sky in discipline that beauty has filled Sri Ramakrishna with ecstasy! On the other hand a discipline which is forced from outside however useful may be we feel it as pressure where as the discipline coming from within, can work as tonic and transform a caterpillar into a butter-fly giving a freedom to fly, a bud into a beautiful flower spreading the fragrance.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one final word in this regard is that the discipline has to come from within and not with imposed feeling. It is also researched that in the society where discipline is introduced culturally, such society is stronger psychologically and the people in that society suffer less psychological problems such as anxiety and depressions compared to the society where this discipline is not there.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VAIRAGYA NON-ATTACHEMNT:</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category of yoga practices according to Sage Patanjali is the non attachment. Whenever we say Vairagya in the name of yoga immediately in many minds and hearts fear and anxiety comes up as if you have to be prepared to give up everything and run away from the material world in to forest. If we closely watch, the idea of Non attachment is also something which is part of the nature. We only need to look at this as the river flowing. River can only be flowing because it continuously letting the water to flow. If this flow is stopped then the water will be stinking and loses its freshness. In the fall trees shed their leaves so that they are prepared to invite and embrace spring with fresh leaves! Life is a flow like a flame of fire. Unless until the old flows, new cannot come and freshness cannot be established. It is our sense of insecurity which makes us not to realise this. It is all due to ignorance that we hold onto no change. We give up something so that we provide room for something new to come in. We have been holding on to vruttis or the modifications in our mind which constantly torment us.&nbsp;&nbsp;These modifications solidify so much that they don&rsquo;t appear any more as modifications but as concrete objects. We don&rsquo;t see them as vruttis any more but we see them as objects. Object itself does not hold on to us. It is the attachment for the object which holds onto us. Like a person who is a non smoker going through a new place does not notice any cigarette shop and one who is a smoker, at once notices every cigarette shop on the way! Once we have attachment for the object then we can notice all our thoughts angers and frustrations are around that object. If only we don&rsquo;t have attachment for that objects all those fall off. The object itself is not holding on to us but we are holding on to the object. A home will not hold onto you. If you forget to lock the home when you are going to the work the home will not express its insecurity. It is our mind which suddenly remembers that we have forgotten to lock the home becomes panic. If we can develop nonattachment, we can be free from the worry of it. We also need to recognise that non attachment does not make us non functional. We are fully functional, and where ever necessary, we function not like slaves but like masters. One thing that develops with this wisdom is that the number of things we constantly desire will fall off. The reason for us to develop attachment is that we feel without that object we are incomplete and insecure and that object is absolutely necessary for us to be at the least in a normal state. Wisdom is that we are full&nbsp;<em>[Purna].&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Our involvement in to this world is not our lacking but we can involve making this world a better place. Without this attitude if we try to give up we are filled with frustration and feeling of loss. In addition we become cynical about others who are involved in the objective world. Every child in the childhood attached to pebbles from the sea shore. But once he becomes an adult he outgrows it very naturally. Same way when yoga says to practice non attachment, it is only suggesting us to grow out of it so that we can be part of the better world or inner world. It is a technique ro give a paradigm shift to out being.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these paths are not new to us we are already doing them. We are learning several things. All this learning if you see is nothing but we are disciplining our body. A child does not have any control over his hands. But we make the child to do continuous practice of writing and the child develops. We have techniques to train hands, legs, voice etc but we have no technique to train our mind towards being calm. This technique of yoga therefore is a unique technique wherein we consciously train our mind to become quite and still, and enable us to transcend our mind in calmness. This way we can go beyond mind to an experience of self.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand we are unconsciously disconnecting our mind from the object. This we do every night by disconnecting our mind from the objective world. When we go to bed wanting to go to sleep, several thoughts, important ideas keep coming to us. But we say enough for all that and we go to bed. This is possible because temporarily we have detached from the material world things to attend etc. But we could temporarily say no to all of them and go to sleep! This is Vairagya and if we cannot do this Vairagya we cannot go to sleep.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the techniques are different, and the methodologies are different, the goal of both of them is the same that is the freedom and mastery.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People with extrovert tendencies by nature have to do something visible a mere clarification is not sufficient. They have to feel the experience of the change. Therefore method of discipline belongs to the people with extravert tendencies. These techniques are visible from outside. A practice of pranayama or meditation, doing some japa or kriya practice, are visible and one can record that he has done so many hours of sadhana. Without such proof he may not feel the confidence that the idea has entered his heart! Therefore an extravert person can enjoy and be benefited by these techniques. On the other hand an introvert person looks at the process of letting go from within. The moment he knows that he should not be holding on to unnecessary mental processes and that is tormenting him he applies that principle repeatedly and be transformed within. He is not so much interested in having to do something outside. Thus the second set is the practices for him.</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example for an introvert person is a professor who is a researcher and thinker. Once in America they wanted everyone to go through military training which included this professor also. The leader of the group was giving instructions right, left, about turn.... the professor stopped mid way. When the leader asked him, &ldquo;Professor, why don&rsquo;t you follow the team&rdquo;, the professor replied first of all decide finally which way to go then I will go.&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulla Nasruddin is a good example for extrovert! He is illiterate and his wife wrote to him a love letter. When the postman delivered that letter to him, Mulla asked him to read it for him. The postman replied with a smile Miya [friend], this is a love letter from your wife and how can i read it. Mulla gave him a suggestion, &ldquo;you read it loud for me and I will close your ears so that you don&rsquo;t hear it&rdquo;!</span></div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all not purely introvert or extrovert. We have both of them and one may be dominating over the other. That is the reason Sage Patanjali suggests that both have to go hand in hand. Techniques of Abhyasa and Vairagya have to be judiciously adapted so that whenever we are having introvert nature dominance we do the Vairagya techniques and when extrovert dominance is there we do abhyasa practices. Ultimately our journey has to be progressing.</span></div>",

      "comment": "<p><span>SUMMARY:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>yoga offers both philosophy and methods of practice. Though some schools may argue that how can&nbsp;&nbsp;the ultimate state of peace and tranquillity the state of Purusha, be the outcome of any doing and if it is so when we are not doing we may lose it. Therefore it should not be product of any doing. What is really required is to realise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage Patanjali rightly says that we are into habit formation of identifying with non self and we need to reverse it so that what habits are not us and we are wrongly identified with, we need to consciously come out of it.</em></span></p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are two methods. One is the method of discipline called &lsquo;Abhyasa&rsquo; and the other is the method of non-attachment, &lsquo;vairagya&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><em><span>Human beings can be divided into two categories according to their psychology and they are extrovert and those who are introvert. Broadly speaking Abhyasa is the type of practices which will be cherished by extravert personalities and Vairagya techniques go well with introvert personalities. But another interesting observation is that no one is purely introvert or extrovert but there can be a dominance of one over the other. Therefore both the types of practices have to go hand in hand. According to one&rsquo;s own nature one of them will take the priority. In addition we also do not stay at all times in one type of personality. Therefore what type works for us at one time may not work at other time period. Therefore the practice of yoga cannot be regimented for all and also cannot be rigid for one all the times.&nbsp;</span></em></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind itself is only an instrument like our hands legs, or eyes and ears. There is nothing good or bad in itself. Like the functioning of eyes is in the form of seeing, same way the functioning of the mind is in the form of thinking. Since it is a very useful tool for us to interact with the material outside in general, the tendency is to get lost in mind itself. In this process we forget that our being is beyond this mind and its activity. Patanjali gives this process of going beyond mind as yoga. Vruttis are the modifications of the mind and to stop and go beyond is the process which will take us to our real nature&nbsp;<em>[swaroopa]</em>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Yogah chitta vrutti nirodhah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatha drastuh Swaroope avastanam</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>&hellip;.</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Abhyasa vairagyabhyam tannirodhah</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done according to Patanjali in two ways one is Abhyasa and the other Vairagya, roughly translated it is method of discipline and the other method of non- attachment or &lsquo;let-go&rsquo;. Let us see how these terms are having mistaken notion and how useful they are when we rightly understand these concepts for the benefit of the spiritual sadhaka.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>DISCIPLINE: the moment we think of discipline there are two positions available. One is the position that one is &lsquo;under discipline&rsquo; and the other one who is &lsquo;disciplining&rsquo;. Psychologically one comes to a hasty conclusion of identifying with the one who is under discipline. This may be because while the child is growing up he or she only keeps hearing others saying constantly do this and don&rsquo;t do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;like receiving orders all the time. Same way when yoga gives dos and don&rsquo;ts this is taken as imposing. When one takes the position of being under discipline it is immediately translated as curtailing your freedom and as a result of it, however useful it may be one would like to come out of discipline at the earliest ,</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our residential therapy facility Prashanti, on the last day of their stay participants come to me to express their gratitude and say, &lsquo;this is a wonderful place and we never knew that yoga has so many components, the practices are wonderful, the therapists are like angels and food is good the discipline of getting up early morning and working for the whole day is so helpful and Dr Nagarathna is like god and I would like to recommend all our family members who need a good therapy to come for treatment here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally they ask &ldquo;Raghuramji, I have one question for you&rdquo;. I ask them what it is. The question is, &ldquo;How long should I continue to do yoga?&rdquo; I wonder if they found yoga to be so useful then why this question of how long to do yoga arises! It is so because they have taken the program at our centre as discipline imposed from outside and not as a discipline coming from within.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality we don&rsquo;t need any discipline from outside. As it is, since we are part of the nature, we are disciplined. In the nature everything is in discipline. Ants walk one behind the other in discipline.

    "body": "<div align=\"justify\">      Whenever I heard the phrase ‘killer instinct’, it always used to create ‘not a good feeling’ and made me very uncomfortable but I never thought about it deeply. Especially when we hear in sports, I never liked it at all. Recently I had to give thought to it when my nephew asked me to give some philosophical background about sports.       </div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      Our seers and sages from the Vedic times held non-violence as the highest virtue with one of the most valuable sutra “<em>Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah</em>” . Parama dharma or the supreme reality or principle is creation. I consider anything that leads to destruction as the highest crime. All other virtues are simple virtues or simple dharmas and non-violence is the supreme virtue indicating that if there is any thing, which is directly opposite to creation, it is violence. The very concept of ‘killer instinct’ has the idea of violence at its core. Therefore, killer instinct is a very bad concept and just cannot be promoted however useful and effective and popular it is!       </div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      In the Astanga yoga of Patanjali ‘ahimsa’ or non violence is given the first place. This is the first of five yamas or disciplines that form the prerequisites for the practice of yoga. When Patanjali gave all these practices such as yama, niyama, asana pranayama etc, it was clearly for ones own personal spiritual growth and definitely not with reference to the world outside. I found many speakers and writers talk about violence, as some thing that has reference only to the world out side. When you look at violence and nonviolence with respect to the world out side, it is obviously  a necessary discipline for a smooth functioning of the society. If some one violates these social norms he/she will become punishable. I feel that if we interpret ahimsa only in the context of social harmony it is a very superficial meaning of ahimsa. It becomes most meaningful if we look  at it as a tool for one’s own growth. Just think for a while&mdash; what will be the amount of damage a person inflicts upon himself physically mentally and spiritually if he takes to the course of violence!</div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As soon as we get any thought of violence, it creates a chain of negative reactions in our mind body complex. The mind gets into a state of agitation and the body chemistry gets terribly disturbed. We pour in huge quantities of adrenalin and steroidal chemicals into the blood that can create enormous amount of imbalance in the body. If you are a sensitive person, the damage done to your mind body complex by these thoughts is much more than the effect it can have on the outside. Interestingly for an insensitive person he will not even realize the damage it does. Whether one perceives it or not the damage is done. Therefore, both the faces of violence are terribly dangerous and cannot be promoted for whatever reason. However, sometimes when all others methods designed to bring about the desirable change in the society or the individual fail, harsh, firm and violent methods are to be used. This does not come under the concept of Ahimsa which is a discipline recommended for individual or social health. After all if any one becomes violent towards the society, the state legislation has provided enough protective measures at different levels starting from the police force to the military , the team that protects law and order. That is a part of the social system and no spiritual teaching is necessary to take care of it.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, Indian philosophy prescribes the concept of non-violence basically for protecting your core personality and the idea of external non violence becomes a by-product of this discipline. Since yoga is a system for developing one’s peace of mind, every recommendation is for the sake of self evolution through introspective correction and not with reference to the world around. Several instructions are recommended for the practice of non-violence as a spiritual discipline and it has to be practiced  kaya, vacha manasa—i.e. at mental level  and through words and action. But for any reason if you need to use harshness for correcting  the evil violent forces, then the suggestion by Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita is to use violence or anger with complete mastery only when necessary as a last resort. And  show harshness and violence outside but never have anger within.your words and  action may look violent but never be harsh in the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say ‘hiss’ like a snake when necessary but never bite.</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Coming back to the concept of ‘killer instinct’ that is widely promoted today in competitive games or sports,I strongly feel that this concept is totally against the very philosophy of sports.It is poisonous because this puts the player’s mind also into a killing mode . It makes him contemplate on killing the opponent. With this very posture, we are harming ourselves and the others..</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The contemplation on this thought of ‘killer instinct’ snowballs over time and  the idea goes so deep into ones mind that the person is emotionally charged with the instinct. This preoccupation aoaks in to the system so much, that when he wins he is a killer but when he looses it kills him!  As a result, his whole life is going to be filled with nothing but violence. This same violence shows up in all other activities. </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">You may tell me ‘ok. I agree that this word is not good; this attitude is not good and not very pleasant. But if I give-up this how can I perform in this competitive world! I will become non-active and a non-performer, leave alone winning in a competitive situation. Is there anything else that you can suggest to be a winner without using this cocept of a killer?’Yes. There is a much healthier attitude. ;an attitude in tune with nature; a concept that can never promote violence; an attitude very much in tune with the discipline of ahimsa. This wonderful life enhancing all encompassing spiritually acceptable concept is that of ‘creativity’.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Become an artist .Who is an artist? He is one whose performance is far far away from any thought of violence. He creates a mesmerizing art piece out of a simple piece of canvas and pencil. A sculptor creates a sculpture out of raw wood or stone. He has an ability to see the hidden beauty and the successful outcome that exists in the plain colorless sheet or the rough piece of stone. The final winning performance is already there even before he puts the first stroke. He only sees the master piece of beauty as if hiding behind the canvas. The sculptor approaches the stone as though the final figure is   pleading him to unfold herself. Once Michel-Angelo was passing by a stone shop and found there was a stone lying by the side of the shop. He went to the owner and wanted to </span><a href=\"http://purchase.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">purchase.it</span></a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">. The shop fellow told him ‘why do you want to buy this stone? in fact  I have actually been waiting to get it out of my way .I will only be thankful if you remove it from here. Michel Angelo smiled and said ‘I will show you this stone after an year’ and took that stone. A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper ‘this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone’. The friend could not believe him. A sculptor, an artist, a creator can hear the voice of life from lifeless. He unfolds the beauty hidden and he will bring about the seemingly impossible. For others it may look to be a challenge, a struggle but for the artist it is like an enchanting journey where every moment is a celebration.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every activity can be done in two ways&ndash; one is the way of fighting and the other is the way of creating. A child’s growth is not a fight but it is like unfolding the inner potential. This is ‘creativity’. Even a game that we play can be in a killer’s way or a creative way. When we do this in a killer’s way as I explained earlier, our focus will be on the opponent and if we are in a creative way then our attention will be on self. When we are in killer’s way we will be spoiling our body chemistry with the bad chemicals in our blood stream where as if we are playing in a creative way then we vitalize the system by pouring in health rejuvenating chemicals such as endorphins into our blood stream. In creative way of playing, there is always a rhythm and in a killer’s way there is a fatigue and break down of the system. One who takes the game in a creative way he will be able to appreciate the game whether he is a winner or looser. Then ‘I’ is not important but the game becomes important. Interestingly when the spectators watch the game, they also do not feel that it is a war but it is a graceful artwork beautifully shaped into some thing worth watching. I watch the Indian cricket team playing. Whether the score is high or low we can see that Virendra Sehwag’s play is so graceful and it is more like an art work than a war. Once, in an interview when the interviewer asked him how he could play against one of the tough bowlers, his reply was so innocent that he said ‘I do not play according to the bowler but I look at each ball and according to its merit’. The same case is with Roger Fedrer playing tennis. It is so graceful to see how he merges in the game and handles it so smoothly and gracefully. He seems to forget both himself  and the opponent. This is probably the reason that we do not see him running around like a mad man in the court and lose his energy.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every skill depends on the training you had. The real skill in training is not only the actual learning of the intricate details of the skill but there is something more. It needs a training in converting all activity into an art piece , an a act of creativity. This is the process of shifting the focus from outside to inside. You need to do it from within and not to focus on the outside. The out side is a situation and ability is inside. Situations are inert. You are the vibrant able being facing all situations.The ability to change the situation to move towards success is the process of training; more challenging the situation more the reward of achievement; more the expression of the inbuilt  freedom.  This is the purpose of playing a game or training in nay skill. This ability to express your inner freedom is called ‘karmasu kaushalam’ by Sri Krishna. This is the choice element that is inbuilt into all living systems. This ability is there in every animal too. You can see this in the monkeys in Amazon forest. They jump from one tree to another tree in a highly skilled artistic way. They only assess and decide about the next leap to the next branch. No other thing is in their purview. They simply express their inner ability. You must see how the little ones are trained by the mother monkey. It is obvious to see how natural it is to become skilled if we do not have the hang ups about the targets but just learn to express the inbuilt inner ability. The difference with man and animals is that they do not know that they are skilled but we as humans have the ability to know that I am the wonderful performer and hence can en joy this expression of the nature’s gift. Now can you see how we have moved from violence and killer instinct to become an artist and a joyful performer? You are an achiever because you could process the expression of the nature’s gift – the ability to adapt and tune to the challenging situation that is inbuilt within all of us. This is what Swami Vivekananda meant when he said ‘each soul is potentially free (divine) and the goal is to manifest this freedom within by controlling nature within and without’. You would be the best player if you decide to express this inbuilt ability in the situation of sports; you would be the best scientist if you chose to express this freedom in the field of unraveling the miseries of nature through mathematical formulae; you will tower the world of music if you express this freedom through culturing the muscles of your fingers on a musical instrument or the muscles of the voice box.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now a days, it is unfortunate that we are hearing more and more incidents of shocking incidents of violence amongst big achievers in any field. It is most disheartening to see this happening amongst sportsmen although the philosophy of sports and games is basically to move away from violence and channelize our energies towards comradeship, team spirit, give and take etc. We have been seeing several such incidents such as misbehavior of sports persons with air-hostesses,</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">; U</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">se of banned drugs for enhancing the performance; loose sexual conduct of reputed sports personnel etc. It is not only these social evils. We are seeing several examples of life style related diseases; e.g. we read that a reputed WWF player died of heart attack at the age of 40 years! This is only one example of several hundred early deaths.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another important feature of the ‘killer instinct’ is that it is like Opium. It takes away your awareness; when you get into the attitude of working for unfolding the creativity, you are deeply set in your awareness. It enhances your awareness; it opens up the inner doors towards purity which can only manifest as more and more compassion and non-violence. Every evil is characterized by lack of awareness. All violent emotions essentially benumb your awareness. Killer instinct is the height of anger against the opponent. Whenever we are angry we lose our awareness to the extent that we do not even know that we are angry and violent.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sri Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita ‘you must participate in the dharma yuddha ( war to remove the incorrigible unrighteous elements in the society) with full awareness; killing is not the thrust ;  to establish the righteousness in the society is the goal ;we had no choice than to adopt this path of war which we accept is violence; but this is the only way to punish the wicked.; oh! Arjuna, become a warrior with full awareness of the purpose and fight for the goal ; establish  a healthy society; this is your duty as a man belonging to the royal dynasty; this is your dharma; in the process you will only manifest your nature, your freedom to be in tune with divinity; you are not the sinner who kills for selfish achievements ; you have to just tune to your inner being and fight’. </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When we as human beings are capable of recognizing such wonderful truths, when we are bestowed with these abilities how can we behave like unaware instinctual beings? Fighting is an instinct for survival. Here we are not trying to survive for earning our bread. Excelling in any field does not need a killer instinct; it only needs a change in our mind set; it is a wonderful expression of creativity; excelling is flowering .For a plant to come out of the soil it needs a little effort of violence but flowering is effortless; it is softness; it is joy ; it is enchanting; it spreads fragrance. How can we accept that sportsmen should have killer instinct? Krishna continues –‘You cannot fight the war efficiently if you do not have inner peace. Your skill comes from the peace within and not when you are driven by your emotions’. If war can become efficient n  a war with your peace within why do we have to think that a player should cherish this poison of killer instinct to be successful? This is the basic notional correction that is necessary for mankind today in any field of achievement; let us promote this change in mind set.</span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The degeneration in sports today resulting in misconduct is a manifestation of this concept of ‘killer instinct’ . Let us make sports healthier by changing the mind set and become creative. This will make sportsmen better human beings.</span></strong></div>\n</div>",

A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper ‘this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone’. The friend could not believe him. A sculptor, an artist, a creator can hear the voice of life from lifeless. He unfolds the beauty hidden and he will bring about the seemingly impossible. For others it may look to be a challenge, a struggle but for the artist it is like an enchanting journey where every moment is a celebration.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every activity can be done in two ways– one is the way of fighting and the other is the way of creating. A child’s growth is not a fight but it is like unfolding the inner potential. This is ‘creativity’. Even a game that we play can be in a killer’s way or a creative way. When we do this in a killer’s way as I explained earlier, our focus will be on the opponent and if we are in a creative way then our attention will be on self. When we are in killer’s way we will be spoiling our body chemistry with the bad chemicals in our blood stream where as if we are playing in a creative way then we vitalize the system by pouring in health rejuvenating chemicals such as endorphins into our blood stream. In creative way of playing, there is always a rhythm and in a killer’s way there is a fatigue and break down of the system. One who takes the game in a creative way he will be able to appreciate the game whether he is a winner or looser. Then ‘I’ is not important but the game becomes important. Interestingly when the spectators watch the game, they also do not feel that it is a war but it is a graceful artwork beautifully shaped into some thing worth watching. I watch the Indian cricket team playing. Whether the score is high or low we can see that Virendra Sehwag’s play is so graceful and it is more like an art work than a war. Once, in an interview when the interviewer asked him how he could play against one of the tough bowlers, his reply was so innocent that he said ‘I do not play according to the bowler but I look at each ball and according to its merit’. The same case is with Roger Fedrer playing tennis. It is so graceful to see how he merges in the game and handles it so smoothly and gracefully. He seems to forget both himself  and the opponent. This is probably the reason that we do not see him running around like a mad man in the court and lose his energy.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every skill depends on the training you had. The real skill in training is not only the actual learning of the intricate details of the skill but there is something more. It needs a training in converting all activity into an art piece , an a act of creativity. This is the process of shifting the focus from outside to inside. You need to do it from within and not to focus on the outside. The out side is a situation and ability is inside. Situations are inert. You are the vibrant able being facing all situations.The ability to change the situation to move towards success is the process of training; more challenging the situation more the reward of achievement; more the expression of the inbuilt  freedom.  This is the purpose of playing a game or training in nay skill. This ability to express your inner freedom is called ‘karmasu kaushalam’ by Sri Krishna. This is the choice element that is inbuilt into all living systems. This ability is there in every animal too. You can see this in the monkeys in Amazon forest. They jump from one tree to another tree in a highly skilled artistic way. They only assess and decide about the next leap to the next branch. No other thing is in their purview. They simply express their inner ability. You must see how the little ones are trained by the mother monkey. It is obvious to see how natural it is to become skilled if we do not have the hang ups about the targets but just learn to express the inbuilt inner ability. The difference with man and animals is that they do not know that they are skilled but we as humans have the ability to know that I am the wonderful performer and hence can en joy this expression of the nature’s gift. Now can you see how we have moved from violence and killer instinct to become an artist and a joyful performer? You are an achiever because you could process the expression of the nature’s gift – the ability to adapt and tune to the challenging situation that is inbuilt within all of us. This is what Swami Vivekananda meant when he said ‘each soul is potentially free (divine) and the goal is to manifest this freedom within by controlling nature within and without’. You would be the best player if you decide to express this inbuilt ability in the situation of sports; you would be the best scientist if you chose to express this freedom in the field of unraveling the miseries of nature through mathematical formulae; you will tower the world of music if you express this freedom through culturing the muscles of your fingers on a musical instrument or the muscles of the voice box.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now a days, it is unfortunate that we are hearing more and more incidents of shocking incidents of violence amongst big achievers in any field. It is most disheartening to see this happening amongst sportsmen although the philosophy of sports and games is basically to move away from violence and channelize our energies towards comradeship, team spirit, give and take etc. We have been seeing several such incidents such as misbehavior of sports persons with air-hostesses,</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">; U</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">se of banned drugs for enhancing the performance; loose sexual conduct of reputed sports personnel etc. It is not only these social evils. We are seeing several examples of life style related diseases; e.g. we read that a reputed WWF player died of heart attack at the age of 40 years! This is only one example of several hundred early deaths.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another important feature of the ‘killer instinct’ is that it is like Opium. It takes away your awareness; when you get into the attitude of working for unfolding the creativity, you are deeply set in your awareness. It enhances your awareness; it opens up the inner doors towards purity which can only manifest as more and more compassion and non-violence. Every evil is characterized by lack of awareness. All violent emotions essentially benumb your awareness. Killer instinct is the height of anger against the opponent. Whenever we are angry we lose our awareness to the extent that we do not even know that we are angry and violent.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sri Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita ‘you must participate in the dharma yuddha ( war to remove the incorrigible unrighteous elements in the society) with full awareness; killing is not the thrust ;  to establish the righteousness in the society is the goal ;we had no choice than to adopt this path of war which we accept is violence; but this is the only way to punish the wicked.; oh! Arjuna, become a warrior with full awareness of the purpose and fight for the goal ; establish  a healthy society; this is your duty as a man belonging to the royal dynasty; this is your dharma; in the process you will only manifest your nature, your freedom to be in tune with divinity; you are not the sinner who kills for selfish achievements ; you have to just tune to your inner being and fight’. </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When we as human beings are capable of recognizing such wonderful truths, when we are bestowed with these abilities how can we behave like unaware instinctual beings? Fighting is an instinct for survival. Here we are not trying to survive for earning our bread. Excelling in any field does not need a killer instinct; it only needs a change in our mind set; it is a wonderful expression of creativity; excelling is flowering .For a plant to come out of the soil it needs a little effort of violence but flowering is effortless; it is softness; it is joy ; it is enchanting; it spreads fragrance. How can we accept that sportsmen should have killer instinct? Krishna continues –‘You cannot fight the war efficiently if you do not have inner peace. Your skill comes from the peace within and not when you are driven by your emotions’. If war can become efficient n  a war with your peace within why do we have to think that a player should cherish this poison of killer instinct to be successful? This is the basic notional correction that is necessary for mankind today in any field of achievement; let us promote this change in mind set.</span><br><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br></span><br><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br></span><br><div align=\"center\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The degeneration in sports today resulting in misconduct is a manifestation of this concept of ‘killer instinct’ .

        "content_raw": "<div align=\"justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I heard the phrase &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo;, it always used to create &lsquo;not a good feeling&rsquo; and made me very uncomfortable but I never thought about it deeply. Especially when we hear in sports, I never liked it at all. Recently I had to give thought to it when my nephew asked me to give some philosophical background about sports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Our seers and sages from the Vedic times held non-violence as the highest virtue with one of the most valuable sutra &ldquo;<em>Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah</em>&rdquo; . Parama dharma or the supreme reality or principle is creation. I consider anything that leads to destruction as the highest crime. All other virtues are simple virtues or simple dharmas and non-violence is the supreme virtue indicating that if there is any thing, which is directly opposite to creation, it is violence. The very concept of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; has the idea of violence at its core. Therefore, killer instinct is a very bad concept and just cannot be promoted however useful and effective and popular it is!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the Astanga yoga of Patanjali &lsquo;ahimsa&rsquo; or non violence is given the first place. This is the first of five yamas or disciplines that form the prerequisites for the practice of yoga. When Patanjali gave all these practices such as yama, niyama, asana pranayama etc, it was clearly for ones own personal spiritual growth and definitely not with reference to the world outside. I found many speakers and writers talk about violence, as some thing that has reference only to the world out side. When you look at violence and nonviolence with respect to the world out side, it is obviously&nbsp; a necessary discipline for a smooth functioning of the society. If some one violates these social norms he/she will become punishable. I feel that if we interpret ahimsa only in the context of social harmony it is a very superficial meaning of ahimsa. It becomes most meaningful if we look&nbsp; at it as a tool for one&rsquo;s own growth. Just think for a while--- what will be the amount of damage a person inflicts upon himself physically mentally and spiritually if he takes to the course of violence!</div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As soon as we get any thought of violence, it creates a chain of negative reactions in our mind body complex. The mind gets into a state of agitation and the body chemistry gets terribly disturbed. We pour in huge quantities of adrenalin and steroidal chemicals into the blood that can create enormous amount of imbalance in the body. If you are a sensitive person, the damage done to your mind body complex by these thoughts is much more than the effect it can have on the outside. Interestingly for an insensitive person he will not even realize the damage it does. Whether one perceives it or not the damage is done. Therefore, both the faces of violence are terribly dangerous and cannot be promoted for whatever reason. However, sometimes when all others methods designed to bring about the desirable change in the society or the individual fail, harsh, firm and violent methods are to be used. This does not come under the concept of Ahimsa which is a discipline recommended for individual or social health. After all if any one becomes violent towards the society, the state legislation has provided enough protective measures at different levels starting from the police force to the military , the team that protects law and order. That is a part of the social system and no spiritual teaching is necessary to take care of it.</span></div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, Indian philosophy prescribes the concept of non-violence basically for protecting your core personality and the idea of external non violence becomes a by-product of this discipline. Since yoga is a system for developing one&rsquo;s peace of mind, every recommendation is for the sake of self evolution through introspective correction and not with reference to the world around. Several instructions are recommended for the practice of non-violence as a spiritual discipline and it has to be practiced&nbsp; kaya, vacha manasa&mdash;i.e. at mental level&nbsp; and through words and action. But for any reason if you need to use harshness for correcting&nbsp; the evil violent forces, then the suggestion by Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita is to use violence or anger with complete mastery only when necessary as a last resort. And&nbsp; show harshness and violence outside but never have anger within.your words and&nbsp; action may look violent but never be harsh in the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say &lsquo;hiss&rsquo; like a snake when necessary but never bite.</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Coming back to the concept of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; that is widely promoted today in competitive games or sports,I strongly feel that this concept is totally against the very philosophy of sports.It is poisonous because this puts the player&rsquo;s mind also into a killing mode . It makes him contemplate on killing the opponent. With this very posture, we are harming ourselves and the others..</span></div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The contemplation on this thought of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; snowballs over time and&nbsp; the idea goes so deep into ones mind that the person is emotionally charged with the instinct. This preoccupation aoaks in to the system so much, that when he wins he is a killer but when he looses it kills him!&nbsp; As a result, his whole life is going to be filled with nothing but violence. This same violence shows up in all other activities.&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">You may tell me &lsquo;ok. I agree that this word is not good; this attitude is not good and not very pleasant. But if I give-up this how can I perform in this competitive world! I will become non-active and a non-performer, leave alone winning in a competitive situation. Is there anything else that you can suggest to be a winner without using this cocept of a killer?&rsquo;Yes. There is a much healthier attitude. ;an attitude in tune with nature; a concept that can never promote violence; an attitude very much in tune with the discipline of ahimsa. This wonderful life enhancing all encompassing spiritually acceptable concept is that of &lsquo;creativity&rsquo;.</span></div>\r\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Become an artist .Who is an artist? He is one whose performance is far far away from any thought of violence. He creates a mesmerizing art piece out of a simple piece of canvas and pencil. A sculptor creates a sculpture out of raw wood or stone. He has an ability to see the hidden beauty and the successful outcome that exists in the plain colorless sheet or the rough piece of stone. The final winning performance is already there even before he puts the first stroke. He only sees the master piece of beauty as if hiding behind the canvas. The sculptor approaches the stone as though the final figure is&nbsp;&nbsp; pleading him to unfold herself. Once Michel-Angelo was passing by a stone shop and found there was a stone lying by the side of the shop. He went to the owner and wanted to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://purchase.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">purchase.it</span></a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">. The shop fellow told him &lsquo;why do you want to buy this stone? in fact&nbsp; I have actually been waiting to get it out of my way .I will only be thankful if you remove it from here. Michel Angelo smiled and said &lsquo;I will show you this stone after an year&rsquo; and took that stone. A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper &lsquo;this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone&rsquo;. The friend could not believe him.

If you are a sensitive person, the damage done to your mind body complex by these thoughts is much more than the effect it can have on the outside. Interestingly for an insensitive person he will not even realize the damage it does. Whether one perceives it or not the damage is done. Therefore, both the faces of violence are terribly dangerous and cannot be promoted for whatever reason. However, sometimes when all others methods designed to bring about the desirable change in the society or the individual fail, harsh, firm and violent methods are to be used. This does not come under the concept of Ahimsa which is a discipline recommended for individual or social health. After all if any one becomes violent towards the society, the state legislation has provided enough protective measures at different levels starting from the police force to the military , the team that protects law and order. That is a part of the social system and no spiritual teaching is necessary to take care of it.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, Indian philosophy prescribes the concept of non-violence basically for protecting your core personality and the idea of external non violence becomes a by-product of this discipline. Since yoga is a system for developing one&rsquo;s peace of mind, every recommendation is for the sake of self evolution through introspective correction and not with reference to the world around. Several instructions are recommended for the practice of non-violence as a spiritual discipline and it has to be practiced&nbsp; kaya, vacha manasa&mdash;i.e. at mental level&nbsp; and through words and action. But for any reason if you need to use harshness for correcting&nbsp; the evil violent forces, then the suggestion by Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita is to use violence or anger with complete mastery only when necessary as a last resort. And&nbsp; show harshness and violence outside but never have anger within.your words and&nbsp; action may look violent but never be harsh in the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say &lsquo;hiss&rsquo; like a snake when necessary but never bite.</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Coming back to the concept of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; that is widely promoted today in competitive games or sports,I strongly feel that this concept is totally against the very philosophy of sports.It is poisonous because this puts the player&rsquo;s mind also into a killing mode . It makes him contemplate on killing the opponent. With this very posture, we are harming ourselves and the others..</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The contemplation on this thought of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; snowballs over time and&nbsp; the idea goes so deep into ones mind that the person is emotionally charged with the instinct. This preoccupation aoaks in to the system so much, that when he wins he is a killer but when he looses it kills him!&nbsp; As a result, his whole life is going to be filled with nothing but violence. This same violence shows up in all other activities.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">You may tell me &lsquo;ok. I agree that this word is not good; this attitude is not good and not very pleasant. But if I give-up this how can I perform in this competitive world! I will become non-active and a non-performer, leave alone winning in a competitive situation. Is there anything else that you can suggest to be a winner without using this cocept of a killer?&rsquo;Yes. There is a much healthier attitude. ;an attitude in tune with nature; a concept that can never promote violence; an attitude very much in tune with the discipline of ahimsa. This wonderful life enhancing all encompassing spiritually acceptable concept is that of &lsquo;creativity&rsquo;.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Become an artist .Who is an artist? He is one whose performance is far far away from any thought of violence. He creates a mesmerizing art piece out of a simple piece of canvas and pencil. A sculptor creates a sculpture out of raw wood or stone. He has an ability to see the hidden beauty and the successful outcome that exists in the plain colorless sheet or the rough piece of stone. The final winning performance is already there even before he puts the first stroke. He only sees the master piece of beauty as if hiding behind the canvas. The sculptor approaches the stone as though the final figure is&nbsp;&nbsp; pleading him to unfold herself. Once Michel-Angelo was passing by a stone shop and found there was a stone lying by the side of the shop. He went to the owner and wanted to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://purchase.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">purchase.it</span></a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">. The shop fellow told him &lsquo;why do you want to buy this stone? in fact&nbsp; I have actually been waiting to get it out of my way .I will only be thankful if you remove it from here. Michel Angelo smiled and said &lsquo;I will show you this stone after an year&rsquo; and took that stone. A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper &lsquo;this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone&rsquo;. The friend could not believe him. A sculptor, an artist, a creator can hear the voice of life from lifeless. He unfolds the beauty hidden and he will bring about the seemingly impossible. For others it may look to be a challenge, a struggle but for the artist it is like an enchanting journey where every moment is a celebration.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every activity can be done in two ways&ndash; one is the way of fighting and the other is the way of creating. A child&rsquo;s growth is not a fight but it is like unfolding the inner potential. This is &lsquo;creativity&rsquo;. Even a game that we play can be in a killer&rsquo;s way or a creative way. When we do this in a killer&rsquo;s way as I explained earlier, our focus will be on the opponent and if we are in a creative way then our attention will be on self. When we are in killer&rsquo;s way we will be spoiling our body chemistry with the bad chemicals in our blood stream where as if we are playing in a creative way then we vitalize the system by pouring in health rejuvenating chemicals such as endorphins into our blood stream. In creative way of playing, there is always a rhythm and in a killer&rsquo;s way there is a fatigue and break down of the system. One who takes the game in a creative way he will be able to appreciate the game whether he is a winner or looser. Then &lsquo;I&rsquo; is not important but the game becomes important. Interestingly when the spectators watch the game, they also do not feel that it is a war but it is a graceful artwork beautifully shaped into some thing worth watching. I watch the Indian cricket team playing. Whether the score is high or low we can see that Virendra Sehwag&rsquo;s play is so graceful and it is more like an art work than a war. Once, in an interview when the interviewer asked him how he could play against one of the tough bowlers, his reply was so innocent that he said &lsquo;I do not play according to the bowler but I look at each ball and according to its merit&rsquo;. The same case is with Roger Fedrer playing tennis. It is so graceful to see how he merges in the game and handles it so smoothly and gracefully. He seems to forget both himself&nbsp; and the opponent. This is probably the reason that we do not see him running around like a mad man in the court and lose his energy.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every skill depends on the training you had. The real skill in training is not only the actual learning of the intricate details of the skill but there is something more. It needs a training in converting all activity into an art piece , an a act of creativity. This is the process of shifting the focus from outside to inside. You need to do it from within and not to focus on the outside. The out side is a situation and ability is inside. Situations are inert. You are the vibrant able being facing all situations.The ability to change the situation to move towards success is the process of training; more challenging the situation more the reward of achievement; more the expression of the inbuilt&nbsp; freedom.&nbsp; This is the purpose of playing a game or training in nay skill. This ability to express your inner freedom is called &lsquo;karmasu kaushalam&rsquo; by Sri Krishna. This is the choice element that is inbuilt into all living systems. This ability is there in every animal too. You can see this in the monkeys in Amazon forest. They jump from one tree to another tree in a highly skilled artistic way. They only assess and decide about the next leap to the next branch. No other thing is in their purview. They simply express their inner ability. You must see how the little ones are trained by the mother monkey. It is obvious to see how natural it is to become skilled if we do not have the hang ups about the targets but just learn to express the inbuilt inner ability. The difference with man and animals is that they do not know that they are skilled but we as humans have the ability to know that I am the wonderful performer and hence can en joy this expression of the nature&rsquo;s gift. Now can you see how we have moved from violence and killer instinct to become an artist and a joyful performer? You are an achiever because you could process the expression of the nature&rsquo;s gift &ndash; the ability to adapt and tune to the challenging situation that is inbuilt within all of us. This is what Swami Vivekananda meant when he said &lsquo;each soul is potentially free (divine) and the goal is to manifest this freedom within by controlling nature within and without&rsquo;. You would be the best player if you decide to express this inbuilt ability in the situation of sports; you would be the best scientist if you chose to express this freedom in the field of unraveling the miseries of nature through mathematical formulae; you will tower the world of music if you express this freedom through culturing the muscles of your fingers on a musical instrument or the muscles of the voice box.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now a days, it is unfortunate that we are hearing more and more incidents of shocking incidents of violence amongst big achievers in any field. It is most disheartening to see this happening amongst sportsmen although the philosophy of sports and games is basically to move away from violence and channelize our energies towards comradeship, team spirit, give and take etc. We have been seeing several such incidents such as misbehavior of sports persons with air-hostesses,</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">; U</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">se of banned drugs for enhancing the performance; loose sexual conduct of reputed sports personnel etc. It is not only these social evils. We are seeing several examples of life style related diseases; e.g. we read that a reputed WWF player died of heart attack at the age of 40 years! This is only one example of several hundred early deaths.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another important feature of the &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; is that it is like Opium. It takes away your awareness; when you get into the attitude of working for unfolding the creativity, you are deeply set in your awareness. It enhances your awareness; it opens up the inner doors towards purity which can only manifest as more and more compassion and non-violence. Every evil is characterized by lack of awareness. All violent emotions essentially benumb your awareness. Killer instinct is the height of anger against the opponent. Whenever we are angry we lose our awareness to the extent that we do not even know that we are angry and violent.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sri Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita &lsquo;you must participate in the dharma yuddha ( war to remove the incorrigible unrighteous elements in the society) with full awareness; killing is not the thrust&nbsp;;&nbsp; to establish the righteousness in the society is the goal ;we had no choice than to adopt this path of war which we accept is violence; but this is the only way to punish the wicked.; oh! Arjuna, become a warrior with full awareness of the purpose and fight for the goal ; establish&nbsp; a healthy society; this is your duty as a man belonging to the royal dynasty; this is your dharma; in the process you will only manifest your nature, your freedom to be in tune with divinity; you are not the sinner who kills for selfish achievements ; you have to just tune to your inner being and fight&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When we as human beings are capable of recognizing such wonderful truths, when we are bestowed with these abilities how can we behave like unaware instinctual beings? Fighting is an instinct for survival. Here we are not trying to survive for earning our bread. Excelling in any field does not need a killer instinct; it only needs a change in our mind set; it is a wonderful expression of creativity; excelling is flowering .For a plant to come out of the soil it needs a little effort of violence but flowering is effortless; it is softness; it is joy ; it is enchanting; it spreads fragrance. How can we accept that sportsmen should have killer instinct? Krishna continues &ndash;&lsquo;You cannot fight the war efficiently if you do not have inner peace. Your skill comes from the peace within and not when you are driven by your emotions&rsquo;. If war can become efficient n&nbsp; a war with your peace within why do we have to think that a player should cherish this poison of killer instinct to be successful? This is the basic notional correction that is necessary for mankind today in any field of achievement; let us promote this change in mind set.</span><br><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br></span><br><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br></span><br><div align=\"center\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The degeneration in sports today resulting in misconduct is a manifestation of this concept of &lsquo;killer instinct&rsquo; . Let us make sports healthier by changing the mind set and become creative. This will make sportsmen better human beings.</span></strong></div>\n</div>",
