What we see is for nourishing what we hear is for our nourishment and definitely what we eat is also for the sake of nourishment. If we take the topic of nourishing by eating it is a very elaborate topic. <span> </span>One aspect o f it is how we eat. Do we eat with hands or do we use cutlery?</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Predominantly in India and especially in south India and religiously in vegetarian places and homes most of the people eat with hands. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Eating with hands is non hygienic is not a very sound argument because invariably people wash their hands thoroughly before sitting for food. There are no evidences that people who eat with hands fall sick more frequently than those who attach food with instruments. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Especially in south Indian culture the food consists of one main item which is rice or roti<span>  </span>or puri etc and there are other items to go with that, which are cooked or fired vegetables, gravy vegetables followed by sambar and rasam and final course of rice with curds. after mixing these things in order to soften the spices in the curries ghee or oil is added according to ones <span> </span>taste. Adults and those who can handle extra spices to enhance the spices or to give special flavours we also have various powders and chatnis and pickles. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This very elaborate system needs a means to mix thoroughly several items in between our eating and with cutlery we cannot achieve it. In fact in my travel all over the world one thing that I noticed is that nowhere else in the world this practice of mixing few things is practiced. When I happened to go to china in the restaurant when we ordered boiled vegetables and rice, the server brings us the vegetables and is waiting for us to finish it so that he can bring in the rice. The service is also in bowls where there is no possibility to mix items! The practice of putting two things together and eating that is available in other cultures is to smear butter or jam onto the bread slice and eat. That is the reason in that cultures they developed using the knife which is convenient. Therefore for eating Indian food we have to use hands so that we can mix them evenly and eat! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Let me now talk about a very fascinating subject the spices. First thing is spices are all vegetable products. Any non-vegetarian food item, any meat or any animal product tastes only salt! It acquires different tastes by adding different spices. In ancient times spices are exported from India to Middle East and Europe and other parts of the world. In Turkey the name of the spices is ‘Bharat’.<span>   </span><span> </span>Indian culture developed an elaborate practice of vegetarian food. Just to give a small example in a dosa place in Bengaluru we have one hundred verities of dosa. That shows the amount of research and invention went into the cooking. If you take red chilli or black pepper or ginger they all have one word for their taste in English called hot! But if we notice there are certain hot stuff which you feel hot when you touch it to the tongue. Some of them create that irritation in the throat. Some others you don’t feel at all while you eat but when it goes into stomach there you feel burning sensation.<span>  </span>Similarly there are certain material which give aroma as it is but some other materials</span> <span>which give aroma and taste when you grind them dry. But some other stuff you cook and eat them as it is that will not give the aroma but some other stuff when you mix them thoroughly then it releases! Simple example is, when you put rasam on rice and mix it the aroma it offers is so different which you will certainly not get if you cook putting all ingredients together.<span>  </span>When you have coriander laves unless you smash them with hands while eating you do not get the smell but the curry leaves just being there in the dish gives the aroma! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Dr Christoph Garner a chief medical director of a hospital in Germany says that he always uses living fork for eating which is his fingers. It is a sight to see everyone in their family his wife and his three daughters two of them are also into medicine all of them eat with the living and flexible forks! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Food is not only for the taste buds on tongue or for the stomach alone. Different glands in us respond differently with different aroma. Your whole personality should assimilate food! First of all when you see the food certain response takes place within and when you are mixing the food you are facilitating the aroma to be released and our glands get activated. Mixing takes some time gap before you put the food in the mouth. That gap of time while mixing and the aroma released while mixing and smashing with hands will allow the necessary interval for your body to prepare to receive the food. Food is to be assimilated by the whole body! In addition to the aroma, seeing the food and touching and feeling the food <span> </span>give some amount of satiation</span> <span>removing the excitement part of eating so that when we eat food we don’t over load!<span>  </span>It is therefore said food belongs to hunger and not for excitement for eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One more aspect of food which helps us to nourish is the touch of the food. When you are touching the food its consistency already sends message to our inner organs those receive this food. First of all, hand finds out the temperature of the food so that mouth is not surprised when you feed. By touching, we also recognise the consistency. The touch and sight when they find something not matching with the colour and consistency immediately you will check before you eat. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>My grandmother always used to say that food is not just for eating but you should also feel the food. That is the reason I suppose in earlier days my grandmother used make the child sit on the ground, put a big plate in front of him, and put freely grains of cooked rice and ghee and some nice boiled soft vegetable pieces. Children use their tender hands and fingers to pick up the grains and try to put in mouth and in the process smear the food all over the body. They would have enjoyed food on their faces, in their hands and everywhere and also would have also dropped around. We would watch with joy how much the child is enjoying the feel of food. After all that the child is given a nice bath! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When you are able to get the nice feeling of satisfaction in mixing and feeling the food it automatically brings about slowness in eating. In addition you also observe and while eating, look at the mechanism that happens. You put food in the mouth while you are chewing you are not waiting. You are mixing and feeling the food and this time gap gives you opportunity to chew the food thoroughly mixing with sufficient amount of saliva which does not happen if you load your mouth fast with a spoon. We have to remind repeatedly to chew the food and it is good for health!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Though it is a little different context I would like to recollect an incident connected with Tagore. Robindranath Tagore went to England at a very early age. After years of learning and completing his studies he was returning to India for the first time. As soon as he got down from the ship he removed his shoes and socks and enjoyed the touch of the soil and feel of the soil with his feel and that was not sufficient he even rolled on the soil while everybody was looking at him surprised. That is the great feeling of satisfaction touching sensation gives us!</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Similarly the touch of the food also brings about subtle satisfaction. That may be the reason many cooks, who cook in Bengaluru for special occasions are thin and lean even though they have plenty of freedom and opportunity to eat every day! They say that they enjoy the cooking so much that they don’t have to eat lot. Those who feel the food or enjoy mixing food with their fingers and enjoying the aroma get their satisfaction partially fulfilled by these activities and only for the rest of the satisfaction they get it by eating! </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>In Upanishads it is said that this body is made up of food. Food is the mother of our body and if we touch the food with that feeling we feel so satisfied and feel nourished. We therefore call food as mother goddess and we offer a prayer annapurne sada purne etc&hellip; <span> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The food that we respect we don’t want to abuse misuse or throw away and waste! The energy which is given by that food which is sanctified by this sacred feeling, how can we use that energy for wrong purposes! Our eating is therefore an offering to god and lLet our eating therefore <span> </span>add goodness in us!!!</span></p>","html":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We interact with the help of <span> </span>our indriyas, senses in this world for the sake of <span> </span>nourishing. What we see is for nourishing what we hear is for our nourishment and definitely what we eat is also for the sake of nourishment. If we take the topic of nourishing by eating it is a very elaborate topic. <span> </span>One aspect o f it is how we eat. Do we eat with hands or do we use cutlery?</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Predominantly in India and especially in south India and religiously in vegetarian places and homes most of the people eat with hands. </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Eating with hands is non hygienic is not a very sound argument because invariably people wash their hands thoroughly before sitting for food. There are no evidences that people who eat with hands fall sick more frequently than those who attach food with instruments. </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Especially in south Indian culture the food consists of one main item which is rice or roti<span>  </span>or puri etc and there are other items to go with that, which are cooked or fired vegetables, gravy vegetables followed by sambar and rasam and final course of rice with curds. after mixing these things in order to soften the spices in the curries ghee or oil is added according to ones <span> </span>taste. Adults and those who can handle extra spices to enhance the spices or to give special flavours we also have various powders and chatnis and pickles. </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>This very elaborate system needs a means to mix thoroughly several items in between our eating and with cutlery we cannot achieve it. In fact in my travel all over the world one thing that I noticed is that nowhere else in the world this practice of mixing few things is practiced. When I happened to go to china in the restaurant when we ordered boiled vegetables and rice, the server brings us the vegetables and is waiting for us to finish it so that he can bring in the rice. The service is also in bowls where there is no possibility to mix items! The practice of putting two things together and eating that is available in other cultures is to smear butter or jam onto the bread slice and eat. That is the reason in that cultures they developed using the knife which is convenient. Therefore for eating Indian food we have to use hands so that we can mix them evenly and eat! </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Let me now talk about a very fascinating subject the spices. First thing is spices are all vegetable products. Any non-vegetarian food item, any meat or any animal product tastes only salt! It acquires different tastes by adding different spices. In ancient times spices are exported from India to Middle East and Europe and other parts of the world. In Turkey the name of the spices is ‘Bharat’.<span>   </span><span> </span>Indian culture developed an elaborate practice of vegetarian food. Just to give a small example in a dosa place in Bengaluru we have one hundred verities of dosa. That shows the amount of research and invention went into the cooking. If you take red chilli or black pepper or ginger they all have one word for their taste in English called hot! But if we notice there are certain hot stuff which you feel hot when you touch it to the tongue. Some of them create that irritation in the throat. Some others you don’t feel at all while you eat but when it goes into stomach there you feel burning sensation.<span>  </span>Similarly there are certain material which give aroma as it is but some other materials</span> <span>which give aroma and taste when you grind them dry. But some other stuff you cook and eat them as it is that will not give the aroma but some other stuff when you mix them thoroughly then it releases! Simple example is, when you put rasam on rice and mix it the aroma it offers is so different which you will certainly not get if you cook putting all ingredients together.<span>  </span>When you have coriander laves unless you smash them with hands while eating you do not get the smell but the curry leaves just being there in the dish gives the aroma! </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Dr Christoph Garner a chief medical director of a hospital in Germany says that he always uses living fork for eating which is his fingers. It is a sight to see everyone in their family his wife and his three daughters two of them are also into medicine all of them eat with the living and flexible forks! </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Food is not only for the taste buds on tongue or for the stomach alone. Different glands in us respond differently with different aroma. Your whole personality should assimilate food! First of all when you see the food certain response takes place within and when you are mixing the food you are facilitating the aroma to be released and our glands get activated. Mixing takes some time gap before you put the food in the mouth. That gap of time while mixing and the aroma released while mixing and smashing with hands will allow the necessary interval for your body to prepare to receive the food. Food is to be assimilated by the whole body! In addition to the aroma, seeing the food and touching and feeling the food <span> </span>give some amount of satiation</span> <span>removing the excitement part of eating so that when we eat food we don’t over load!<span>  </span>It is therefore said food belongs to hunger and not for excitement for eating! </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>One more aspect of food which helps us to nourish is the touch of the food. When you are touching the food its consistency already sends message to our inner organs those receive this food. First of all, hand finds out the temperature of the food so that mouth is not surprised when you feed. By touching, we also recognise the consistency. The touch and sight when they find something not matching with the colour and consistency immediately you will check before you eat. </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>My grandmother always used to say that food is not just for eating but you should also feel the food. That is the reason I suppose in earlier days my grandmother used make the child sit on the ground, put a big plate in front of him, and put freely grains of cooked rice and ghee and some nice boiled soft vegetable pieces. Children use their tender hands and fingers to pick up the grains and try to put in mouth and in the process smear the food all over the body. They would have enjoyed food on their faces, in their hands and everywhere and also would have also dropped around. We would watch with joy how much the child is enjoying the feel of food. After all that the child is given a nice bath! </span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When you are able to get the nice feeling of satisfaction in mixing and feeling the food it automatically brings about slowness in eating.

According to one’s own nature one of them will take the priority. In addition we also do not stay at all times in one type of personality. Therefore what type works for us at one time may not work at other time period. Therefore the practice of yoga cannot be regimented for all and also cannot be rigid for one all the times. </span></em></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Mind itself is only an instrument like our hands legs, or eyes and ears. There is nothing good or bad in itself. Like the functioning of eyes is in the form of seeing, same way the functioning of the mind is in the form of thinking. Since it is a very useful tool for us to interact with the material outside in general, the tendency is to get lost in mind itself. In this process we forget that our being is beyond this mind and its activity. Patanjali gives this process of going beyond mind as yoga. Vruttis are the modifications of the mind and to stop and go beyond is the process which will take us to our real nature <em>[swaroopa]</em>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Yogah chitta vrutti nirodhah            Tatha drastuh Swaroope avastanam</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>&hellip;.</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><em><span>Abhyasa vairagyabhyam tannirodhah</span></em></strong></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This can be done according to Patanjali in two ways one is Abhyasa and the other Vairagya, roughly translated it is method of discipline and the other method of non- attachment or ‘let-go’. Let us see how these terms are having mistaken notion and how useful they are when we rightly understand these concepts for the benefit of the spiritual sadhaka.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>DISCIPLINE: the moment we think of discipline there are two positions available. One is the position that one is ‘under discipline’ and the other one who is ‘disciplining’. Psychologically one comes to a hasty conclusion of identifying with the one who is under discipline. This may be because while the child is growing up he or she only keeps hearing others saying constantly do this and don’t do this,  like receiving orders all the time. Same way when yoga gives dos and don’ts this is taken as imposing. When one takes the position of being under discipline it is immediately translated as curtailing your freedom and as a result of it, however useful it may be one would like to come out of discipline at the earliest ,</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In our residential therapy facility Prashanti, on the last day of their stay participants come to me to express their gratitude and say, ‘this is a wonderful place and we never knew that yoga has so many components, the practices are wonderful, the therapists are like angels and food is good the discipline of getting up early morning and working for the whole day is so helpful and Dr Nagarathna is like god and I would like to recommend all our family members who need a good therapy to come for treatment here.  Finally they ask “Raghuramji, I have one question for you”. I ask them what it is. The question is, “How long should I continue to do yoga?” I wonder if they found yoga to be so useful then why this question of how long to do yoga arises! It is so because they have taken the program at our centre as discipline imposed from outside and not as a discipline coming from within.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In reality we don’t need any discipline from outside. As it is, since we are part of the nature, we are disciplined. In the nature everything is in discipline. Ants walk one behind the other in discipline. Birds in the sky fly in discipline in nice formations. Every cocoanut tree has similar leaves in the form of discipline anywhere in the world and we can recognise it to be cocoanut tree from distance! You can find discipline everywhere in the nature. Birds wakeup in the morning at the same time in a disciplined way that is why we have birds voice for the clocks! The same way you can find natural discipline in the children they are hungry at the same time every day they go to sleep at the same time every day. Their pattern does not depend upon whether it is week day or week-end. We also used to have this discipline when we were children. But as we grew up we have come out of discipline. Therefore lack of discipline is an imposed habit but the discipline is part of our nature! When Patanjali says to discipline, it is not to impose discipline on us but to remove the indiscipline which unconsciously we acquired on us. We don’t have to feel we are slaves under discipline. But we are the masters who are disciplining the unruly forces which work as tendencies to take us away from discipline. Discipline has some other qualities too. Discipline is strength. See the crowd of people in a market place moving around without any discipline in different directions. They appear like crowd. The same crowd put them in rank and file and make them march for a disciplined footsteps in the form of an army that shows immediately the strength of the army. Discipline is also beautiful. When we plant the crops in nice lines stretching for miles you can feel that beauty of such agriculture fields. When the birds are flying in formation on the sky in discipline that beauty has filled Sri Ramakrishna with ecstasy! On the other hand a discipline which is forced from outside however useful may be we feel it as pressure where as the discipline coming from within, can work as tonic and transform a caterpillar into a butter-fly giving a freedom to fly, a bud into a beautiful flower spreading the fragrance.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Therefore, one final word in this regard is that the discipline has to come from within and not with imposed feeling. It is also researched that in the society where discipline is introduced culturally, such society is stronger psychologically and the people in that society suffer less psychological problems such as anxiety and depressions compared to the society where this discipline is not there.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VAIRAGYA NON-ATTACHEMNT:</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The other category of yoga practices according to Sage Patanjali is the non attachment. Whenever we say Vairagya in the name of yoga immediately in many minds and hearts fear and anxiety comes up as if you have to be prepared to give up everything and run away from the material world in to forest. If we closely watch, the idea of Non attachment is also something which is part of the nature. We only need to look at this as the river flowing. River can only be flowing because it continuously letting the water to flow. If this flow is stopped then the water will be stinking and loses its freshness. In the fall trees shed their leaves so that they are prepared to invite and embrace spring with fresh leaves! Life is a flow like a flame of fire. Unless until the old flows, new cannot come and freshness cannot be established. It is our sense of insecurity which makes us not to realise this. It is all due to ignorance that we hold onto no change. We give up something so that we provide room for something new to come in. We have been holding on to vruttis or the modifications in our mind which constantly torment us.  These modifications solidify so much that they don’t appear any more as modifications but as concrete objects. We don’t see them as vruttis any more but we see them as objects. Object itself does not hold on to us. It is the attachment for the object which holds onto us. Like a person who is a non smoker going through a new place does not notice any cigarette shop and one who is a smoker, at once notices every cigarette shop on the way! Once we have attachment for the object then we can notice all our thoughts angers and frustrations are around that object. If only we don’t have attachment for that objects all those fall off. The object itself is not holding on to us but we are holding on to the object. A home will not hold onto you. If you forget to lock the home when you are going to the work the home will not express its insecurity. It is our mind which suddenly remembers that we have forgotten to lock the home becomes panic. If we can develop nonattachment, we can be free from the worry of it. We also need to recognise that non attachment does not make us non functional. We are fully functional, and where ever necessary, we function not like slaves but like masters. One thing that develops with this wisdom is that the number of things we constantly desire will fall off. The reason for us to develop attachment is that we feel without that object we are incomplete and insecure and that object is absolutely necessary for us to be at the least in a normal state. Wisdom is that we are full <em>[Purna]. </em> Our involvement in to this world is not our lacking but we can involve making this world a better place. Without this attitude if we try to give up we are filled with frustration and feeling of loss. In addition we become cynical about others who are involved in the objective world. Every child in the childhood attached to pebbles from the sea shore. But once he becomes an adult he outgrows it very naturally. Same way when yoga says to practice non attachment, it is only suggesting us to grow out of it so that we can be part of the better world or inner world. It is a technique ro give a paradigm shift to out being.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Both these paths are not new to us we are already doing them. We are learning several things. All this learning if you see is nothing but we are disciplining our body. A child does not have any control over his hands. But we make the child to do continuous practice of writing and the child develops. We have techniques to train hands, legs, voice etc but we have no technique to train our mind towards being calm. This technique of yoga therefore is a unique technique wherein we consciously train our mind to become quite and still, and enable us to transcend our mind in calmness. This way we can go beyond mind to an experience of self.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            On the other hand we are unconsciously disconnecting our mind from the object. This we do every night by disconnecting our mind from the objective world. When we go to bed wanting to go to sleep, several thoughts, important ideas keep coming to us. But we say enough for all that and we go to bed. This is possible because temporarily we have detached from the material world things to attend etc. But we could temporarily say no to all of them and go to sleep! This is Vairagya and if we cannot do this Vairagya we cannot go to sleep.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Though the techniques are different, and the methodologies are different, the goal of both of them is the same that is the freedom and mastery.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            People with extrovert tendencies by nature have to do something visible a mere clarification is not sufficient. They have to feel the experience of the change. Therefore method of discipline belongs to the people with extravert tendencies. These techniques are visible from outside. A practice of pranayama or meditation, doing some japa or kriya practice, are visible and one can record that he has done so many hours of sadhana. Without such proof he may not feel the confidence that the idea has entered his heart! Therefore an extravert person can enjoy and be benefited by these techniques. On the other hand an introvert person looks at the process of letting go from within. The moment he knows that he should not be holding on to unnecessary mental processes and that is tormenting him he applies that principle repeatedly and be transformed within. He is not so much interested in having to do something outside. Thus the second set is the practices for him.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            An example for an introvert person is a professor who is a researcher and thinker. Once in America they wanted everyone to go through military training which included this professor also. The leader of the group was giving instructions right, left, about turn&hellip;. the professor stopped mid way. When the leader asked him, “Professor, why don’t you follow the team”, the professor replied first of all decide finally which way to go then I will go. </span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Mulla Nasruddin is a good example for extrovert! He is illiterate and his wife wrote to him a love letter. When the postman delivered that letter to him, Mulla asked him to read it for him. The postman replied with a smile Miya [friend], this is a love letter from your wife and how can i read it. Mulla gave him a suggestion, “you read it loud for me and I will close your ears so that you don’t hear it”!</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            We are all not purely introvert or extrovert. We have both of them and one may be dominating over the other. That is the reason Sage Patanjali suggests that both have to go hand in hand. Techniques of Abhyasa and Vairagya have to be judiciously adapted so that whenever we are having introvert nature dominance we do the Vairagya techniques and when extrovert dominance is there we do abhyasa practices. Ultimately our journey has to be progressing.</span></div>","html":"<p><span>SUMMARY:  <em>yoga offers both philosophy and methods of practice.

On the other hand a discipline which is forced from outside however useful may be we feel it as pressure where as the discipline coming from within, can work as tonic and transform a caterpillar into a butter-fly giving a freedom to fly, a bud into a beautiful flower spreading the fragrance.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Therefore, one final word in this regard is that the discipline has to come from within and not with imposed feeling. It is also researched that in the society where discipline is introduced culturally, such society is stronger psychologically and the people in that society suffer less psychological problems such as anxiety and depressions compared to the society where this discipline is not there.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>VAIRAGYA NON-ATTACHEMNT:</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The other category of yoga practices according to Sage Patanjali is the non attachment. Whenever we say Vairagya in the name of yoga immediately in many minds and hearts fear and anxiety comes up as if you have to be prepared to give up everything and run away from the material world in to forest. If we closely watch, the idea of Non attachment is also something which is part of the nature. We only need to look at this as the river flowing. River can only be flowing because it continuously letting the water to flow. If this flow is stopped then the water will be stinking and loses its freshness. In the fall trees shed their leaves so that they are prepared to invite and embrace spring with fresh leaves! Life is a flow like a flame of fire. Unless until the old flows, new cannot come and freshness cannot be established. It is our sense of insecurity which makes us not to realise this. It is all due to ignorance that we hold onto no change. We give up something so that we provide room for something new to come in. We have been holding on to vruttis or the modifications in our mind which constantly torment us.  These modifications solidify so much that they don’t appear any more as modifications but as concrete objects. We don’t see them as vruttis any more but we see them as objects. Object itself does not hold on to us. It is the attachment for the object which holds onto us. Like a person who is a non smoker going through a new place does not notice any cigarette shop and one who is a smoker, at once notices every cigarette shop on the way! Once we have attachment for the object then we can notice all our thoughts angers and frustrations are around that object. If only we don’t have attachment for that objects all those fall off. The object itself is not holding on to us but we are holding on to the object. A home will not hold onto you. If you forget to lock the home when you are going to the work the home will not express its insecurity. It is our mind which suddenly remembers that we have forgotten to lock the home becomes panic. If we can develop nonattachment, we can be free from the worry of it. We also need to recognise that non attachment does not make us non functional. We are fully functional, and where ever necessary, we function not like slaves but like masters. One thing that develops with this wisdom is that the number of things we constantly desire will fall off. The reason for us to develop attachment is that we feel without that object we are incomplete and insecure and that object is absolutely necessary for us to be at the least in a normal state. Wisdom is that we are full <em>[Purna]. </em> Our involvement in to this world is not our lacking but we can involve making this world a better place. Without this attitude if we try to give up we are filled with frustration and feeling of loss. In addition we become cynical about others who are involved in the objective world. Every child in the childhood attached to pebbles from the sea shore. But once he becomes an adult he outgrows it very naturally. Same way when yoga says to practice non attachment, it is only suggesting us to grow out of it so that we can be part of the better world or inner world. It is a technique ro give a paradigm shift to out being.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Both these paths are not new to us we are already doing them. We are learning several things. All this learning if you see is nothing but we are disciplining our body. A child does not have any control over his hands. But we make the child to do continuous practice of writing and the child develops. We have techniques to train hands, legs, voice etc but we have no technique to train our mind towards being calm. This technique of yoga therefore is a unique technique wherein we consciously train our mind to become quite and still, and enable us to transcend our mind in calmness. This way we can go beyond mind to an experience of self.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            On the other hand we are unconsciously disconnecting our mind from the object. This we do every night by disconnecting our mind from the objective world. When we go to bed wanting to go to sleep, several thoughts, important ideas keep coming to us. But we say enough for all that and we go to bed. This is possible because temporarily we have detached from the material world things to attend etc. But we could temporarily say no to all of them and go to sleep! This is Vairagya and if we cannot do this Vairagya we cannot go to sleep.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Though the techniques are different, and the methodologies are different, the goal of both of them is the same that is the freedom and mastery.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            People with extrovert tendencies by nature have to do something visible a mere clarification is not sufficient. They have to feel the experience of the change. Therefore method of discipline belongs to the people with extravert tendencies. These techniques are visible from outside. A practice of pranayama or meditation, doing some japa or kriya practice, are visible and one can record that he has done so many hours of sadhana. Without such proof he may not feel the confidence that the idea has entered his heart! Therefore an extravert person can enjoy and be benefited by these techniques. On the other hand an introvert person looks at the process of letting go from within. The moment he knows that he should not be holding on to unnecessary mental processes and that is tormenting him he applies that principle repeatedly and be transformed within. He is not so much interested in having to do something outside. Thus the second set is the practices for him.</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            An example for an introvert person is a professor who is a researcher and thinker. Once in America they wanted everyone to go through military training which included this professor also. The leader of the group was giving instructions right, left, about turn&hellip;. the professor stopped mid way. When the leader asked him, “Professor, why don’t you follow the team”, the professor replied first of all decide finally which way to go then I will go. </span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Mulla Nasruddin is a good example for extrovert! He is illiterate and his wife wrote to him a love letter. When the postman delivered that letter to him, Mulla asked him to read it for him. The postman replied with a smile Miya [friend], this is a love letter from your wife and how can i read it. Mulla gave him a suggestion, “you read it loud for me and I will close your ears so that you don’t hear it”!</span></div>  \n\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            We are all not purely introvert or extrovert. We have both of them and one may be dominating over the other. That is the reason Sage Patanjali suggests that both have to go hand in hand. Techniques of Abhyasa and Vairagya have to be judiciously adapted so that whenever we are having introvert nature dominance we do the Vairagya techniques and when extrovert dominance is there we do abhyasa practices. Ultimately our journey has to be progressing.</span></div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Sage Patanjali's Recommendations for Practice of Yoga","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2011-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-04-20T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":7,"uuid":"4a45146c-cf58-4513-bd03-2248de241550","title":"How to do Meditation - Meditasyon Nasıl Yapılır by Sri NV Raghuram","slug":"how-to-do-meditation-meditasyon-nasil-yapilir-by-sri-nv-raghuram","markdown":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VERrV5rMItY?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","html":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VERrV5rMItY?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"How to do Meditation - Meditasyon Nasıl Yapılır by Sri NV Raghuram","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2011-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-03-28T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":8,"uuid":"4e01de3a-ca7d-4c15-9638-9acc7bdc100c","title":"Guru Mantra Chanting by Sri NV Raghuram","slug":"guru-mantra-chanting-by-sri-nv-raghuram","markdown":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3UgmKTaPnZc?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","html":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3UgmKTaPnZc?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Guru Mantra Chanting by Sri NV Raghuram","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-11-09T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-11-09T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-11-09T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":9,"uuid":"5ebe2ac7-ed70-4d13-980c-c1f60cea41d2","title":"Energy Transfer from guru to student by Sri NV Raghuram","slug":"energy-transfer-from-guru-to-student-by-sri-nv-raghuram","markdown":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BZWmEHDmVU8?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","html":"<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BZWmEHDmVU8?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Energy Transfer from guru to student by Sri NV Raghuram","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-10-20T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-10-20T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-10-20T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":10,"uuid":"06c6d061-7c1c-4821-91de-f9b08ae9212a","title":"Maitrimilan talk - August 2, 2010","slug":"maitrimilan-talk-august-2-2010","markdown":"<p><span>In the link you may listen to the voice recording of Maitrimilan talk of Raghuramji. </span><br/><br/><span>Maitrimilan (ie cordial gathering of all the inmates of prashanit Kuteeram the residential campus) took place in the auditorium of Vivekanda Yoga University. </span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Mitrimilan020810.WAV\">http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Mitrimilan020810.WAV</a></p>","html":"<p><span>In the link you may listen to the voice recording of Maitrimilan talk of Raghuramji. </span><br/><br/><span>Maitrimilan (ie cordial gathering of all the inmates of prashanit Kuteeram the residential campus) took place in the auditorium of Vivekanda Yoga University. </span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Mitrimilan020810.WAV\">http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Mitrimilan020810.WAV</a></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Maitrimilan talk - August 2, 2010","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-09-23T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-09-23T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-09-23T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":11,"uuid":"26e7de50-53b2-4b7e-af56-19481f48adf3","title":"What is health?","slug":"what-is-health","markdown":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuram answers the questions:</span><br/><span>1.

On the contrary, yogis believed to have seen 10 pranas [and nadis]. How can or will scientists understand the role of panca pranas in healing?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  Modern day scientists can understand that in order for the lungs to move we require power behind lung muscles and this power is a form of energy because for performing any kind of activity we require energy. The growth of an individual also requires energy.  The only source of energy we have is the food we consume. This alone cannot explain every activity we do. Therefore, Indian philosophy has given the idea that we are born with some thing similar to energy, which is called as prana. In my talk, I explained that prana is not what in the lungs but it is that which is behind the lung muscles, which makes respiratory system to function like other systems namely circulatory nervous and digestive systems function.</span><br/><br/><span>Yoga science and for that matter all Indian philosophy is based on the inner observation. Accordingly we all perceive inner activity going on and some inner scientists have divided it into five parts an some have given it is seven parts  and some in ten. What matters is what we do with this division. If that division is helping us to proceed in establishing our mastery over self then it is useful. If that division is not helpful in developing mastery over self but for academic interest then we do not have to give importance to it so much. If we can explain prana or pranic healing in this language then we can convince an open-minded thinker be it a scientist or anybody else.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: will you help in negative thinking? Please give the way.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  the whole purpose of spiritual knowledge is to help one to have positive thinking. If we start taking simple steps in life and seeing that, we are capable of doing them then we develop positive outlook of life. If we are looking at only failures in life and if we are looking at the inefficiencies of the world then we are filled with negativity. In addition, to look at things negative we do not require any awareness and to look at things positive it is a conscious process!</span><br/><br/><span>Question: mind consists of manas buddhi chitta ahankara – so what happens in a particular situation especially when one is in stressful situation; not able to have a discerning ability of what is right or wrong – real or unreal in the particular situation.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer: according to the Indian philosophy all that which is available for the sensory organs is called as GROSS WORLD or stula world. Then they have categorized what can be experienced directly by the sensory organs or the instruments, is called as Sukshma world. In that, we have in our experience two things. One is the force, which is responsible for activities, which is called as prana.  We have another aspect which is responsible for further  inner layer of activity which is called as further sukshma and that is the mind which is called as manas which is characterized by several functions like collecting information, analysing and memorising and recollecting. These are given the names as manas buddhi etc.</span><br/><br/><span>We experience stressful when the smooth harmony between these faculties is disturbed and we find one is not cooperating with the others requirements. Like for a student in exam hall he wants to recollect some thing, which is there in his memory but it does not cooperate and he ends up with stress and frustration.   In such a situation, if we observe within we can notice every faculty is with tremendous speed. All that we require is to slow down the inner speed. Be an observer then we are not identified with the situation and it is easy to slow down and calm. In that calm state, our discerning ability will come back! Hook the mind on to deep breathing by observing the breath for four or five respirations and with that the mind slows and you develop inner awareness.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: a thought experiment – to trap consciousness.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer: As I know, consciousness is the freedom which means it does not have any bondage By giving up this freedom only consciousness becomes matter which is always available for us to trap. Therefore, I do not quite follow the question called to trap consciousness. This is like saying a very bright darkness. Darkness means there is no light and no brightness.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: can pranayama open up the love within oneself. From where does love come?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  Pranayama will help to open up the love within by two processes.</span><br/><br/><span>Pranayama is a practice for slowing inner activity. When, we slow the breath with pranayama practices, all inner activities slow. Inner emotions like love compassion etc are slow emotions and anger hatred etc are violent emotions. Therefore, like the way when the rains come soaking the ground with water, the seeds hidden for days and months under the ground unnoticed will sprout filling the land with life in the same way once the inner life force prana slows the hidden natural life called love springs up!</span><br/><br/><span>The second aspect is an indirect connection. Whenever we are away from love in the form of hatred or complaint etc, we have lost our awareness and when we regain our awareness then the anger hatred frustration etc drop or dissolve. Pranayama techniques are done with awareness and they tend to build awareness!  This awareness opens up deep hidden love to the surface. Another added benefit is that when we are able to slowdown the prana activity within it also adds to the feeling of wellness and satisfaction. The sings of frustration, irritation and anger are the products of dissatisfaction. This way, also love unfolds itself with the practice of pranayama.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: Through the ways of correcting prana, can the ego of a person be tamed or removed? Can we change evil tendencies through pranic correction? If so, what is the source of all human tendencies?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  The answer for this question is also similar in its understanding as given for the earlier question. In addition it s said that love is the greatest alchemy to dissolve our ego. When we are in love, we do not care to protect our ego and it spontaneously dissolves. All our acts of evil are speed in nature that is why it is said when you want to do some thing bad postpone it and slow it for some time later then you may not do the evil at all. Slowness removes the evil tendencies. Especially the slowness brought about in prana is some thing, which will bring slowness in every cell in the body. Therefore, the practice of pranayama not only brings about the improvement of an individual but it also brings about greater harmony and social morality.</span><br/><br/><span>Question:  yoga – to come out of all habits like liquor, smoking etc?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  according to the yoga psychology the habit s like smoking drinking etc do not start as problems but they start initially as supports for the other underlying problems and these things would have given as props to escape from those problems. However, when one is habituated to these things then they appear as problems.</span><br/><br/><span>Problems keep coming and going to every one. That is life. Some times, he feels strong enough to face the problems but some times the problems baffle him and he feels weak. It is in such weak moments one falls pray to various habits. Feeling weak is the result of lack of inner awareness and frustration. Feeling weak is also the result of not accepting the reality. Yoga makes to come in touch with one self and core of one self, which in turn helps one not to resort to the external support. It also strengthens one to come out of external support for his problems.  But it requires an expert guidance so that he a proper environment is created and proper sequence of practices is designed so that he can come out of his problems with the help of the practice of yoga.  Some times, there are other stricter methods to come out of addictions and a person can take to come to our centre to over come or handle the withdrawal symptoms, which in some cases is necessary!</span><br/><br/><span>Question: I have read/ heard yogis can bring down breath to 1 breath per minute, but if the breath goes still longer could you please explain what would happen to yogis’ consciousness/ energy/ outlook to life/ will he be in Samadhi always. It is interesting to know please guide.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  consciousness is the one, which becomes prana, which is also known as life force. This life force is responsible for all activities in our body and one of its functions is respiration. This respiration activity is semi voluntary that means that it will adjust itself according to our requirement. When we are climbing up the hill we need more oxygen and then the rate and depth of respiration automatically adjusts and we breathe deep. The same thing when we relax we do not need so much oxygen and for that reason automatically our respiratory rate will come down. When we say yogis reduce their respiratory rate they calm their inner activity or in other words they relax so much that they are doing very less activity within and in turn they require less amount of oxygen. Therefore, their respiratory rate has come down and together their requirement of oxygen comes down. Therefore, when their breath rate comes down due to meditation etc practices, their consciousness or life energy or prana is more conserved and their outlook of life will be one of pleasantness filled with positive feeling. They are in a very relaxed state which ordinary person can call as very near to Samadhi state!</span><br/><br/><span>Question: what are mind and intellect?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  According to Indian wisdom, we have inner faculties where we handle several functions. All these functions such as memory intention will to do or analysis etc all these functions id known by one single word called ‘manas or antahkaran or inner instruments’. Out of this Indian philosophy gave different names for different functional aspects. We can understand this with the help of a crude example. What coordinated all the sense inputs is called as manas. Like we see hear a sound and immediately we turn our head to see in that direction. What is in us, which said that sound is coming from this direction and we need to look in that direction? This aspect is called as manas. Intellect is the faculty, which analyses the input into us through what we see etc with the help of input from our memory and what is our desire etc.  This is much more subtle function compared to the functioning of mind.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: is there a difference between pranayama done in a sylvan atmosphere   and that done in a highly polluted city granting the room is very clean? If yes does it mean that most public cannot reap full benefit.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  Certainly, the quality of air that we breathe is important for our health point of view. Same rule applies in practicing of pranayama also. The practice of pranayama is supposed to help us to reduce the expenditure of prana in our activities, which will be there wherever you practice pranayama. If one can help to find clean atmosphere go for it but if it is not possible then that much bad effect will be there and benefits of pranayama is reduced.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Question: for scientists and medical professionals only air and its movement up to lungs make sense.

Hook the mind on to deep breathing by observing the breath for four or five respirations and with that the mind slows and you develop inner awareness.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: a thought experiment – to trap consciousness.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer: As I know, consciousness is the freedom which means it does not have any bondage By giving up this freedom only consciousness becomes matter which is always available for us to trap. Therefore, I do not quite follow the question called to trap consciousness. This is like saying a very bright darkness. Darkness means there is no light and no brightness.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: can pranayama open up the love within oneself. From where does love come?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  Pranayama will help to open up the love within by two processes.</span><br/><br/><span>Pranayama is a practice for slowing inner activity. When, we slow the breath with pranayama practices, all inner activities slow. Inner emotions like love compassion etc are slow emotions and anger hatred etc are violent emotions. Therefore, like the way when the rains come soaking the ground with water, the seeds hidden for days and months under the ground unnoticed will sprout filling the land with life in the same way once the inner life force prana slows the hidden natural life called love springs up!</span><br/><br/><span>The second aspect is an indirect connection. Whenever we are away from love in the form of hatred or complaint etc, we have lost our awareness and when we regain our awareness then the anger hatred frustration etc drop or dissolve. Pranayama techniques are done with awareness and they tend to build awareness!  This awareness opens up deep hidden love to the surface. Another added benefit is that when we are able to slowdown the prana activity within it also adds to the feeling of wellness and satisfaction. The sings of frustration, irritation and anger are the products of dissatisfaction. This way, also love unfolds itself with the practice of pranayama.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: Through the ways of correcting prana, can the ego of a person be tamed or removed? Can we change evil tendencies through pranic correction? If so, what is the source of all human tendencies?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  The answer for this question is also similar in its understanding as given for the earlier question. In addition it s said that love is the greatest alchemy to dissolve our ego. When we are in love, we do not care to protect our ego and it spontaneously dissolves. All our acts of evil are speed in nature that is why it is said when you want to do some thing bad postpone it and slow it for some time later then you may not do the evil at all. Slowness removes the evil tendencies. Especially the slowness brought about in prana is some thing, which will bring slowness in every cell in the body. Therefore, the practice of pranayama not only brings about the improvement of an individual but it also brings about greater harmony and social morality.</span><br/><br/><span>Question:  yoga – to come out of all habits like liquor, smoking etc?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  according to the yoga psychology the habit s like smoking drinking etc do not start as problems but they start initially as supports for the other underlying problems and these things would have given as props to escape from those problems. However, when one is habituated to these things then they appear as problems.</span><br/><br/><span>Problems keep coming and going to every one. That is life. Some times, he feels strong enough to face the problems but some times the problems baffle him and he feels weak. It is in such weak moments one falls pray to various habits. Feeling weak is the result of lack of inner awareness and frustration. Feeling weak is also the result of not accepting the reality. Yoga makes to come in touch with one self and core of one self, which in turn helps one not to resort to the external support. It also strengthens one to come out of external support for his problems.  But it requires an expert guidance so that he a proper environment is created and proper sequence of practices is designed so that he can come out of his problems with the help of the practice of yoga.  Some times, there are other stricter methods to come out of addictions and a person can take to come to our centre to over come or handle the withdrawal symptoms, which in some cases is necessary!</span><br/><br/><span>Question: I have read/ heard yogis can bring down breath to 1 breath per minute, but if the breath goes still longer could you please explain what would happen to yogis’ consciousness/ energy/ outlook to life/ will he be in Samadhi always. It is interesting to know please guide.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  consciousness is the one, which becomes prana, which is also known as life force. This life force is responsible for all activities in our body and one of its functions is respiration. This respiration activity is semi voluntary that means that it will adjust itself according to our requirement. When we are climbing up the hill we need more oxygen and then the rate and depth of respiration automatically adjusts and we breathe deep. The same thing when we relax we do not need so much oxygen and for that reason automatically our respiratory rate will come down. When we say yogis reduce their respiratory rate they calm their inner activity or in other words they relax so much that they are doing very less activity within and in turn they require less amount of oxygen. Therefore, their respiratory rate has come down and together their requirement of oxygen comes down. Therefore, when their breath rate comes down due to meditation etc practices, their consciousness or life energy or prana is more conserved and their outlook of life will be one of pleasantness filled with positive feeling. They are in a very relaxed state which ordinary person can call as very near to Samadhi state!</span><br/><br/><span>Question: what are mind and intellect?</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  According to Indian wisdom, we have inner faculties where we handle several functions. All these functions such as memory intention will to do or analysis etc all these functions id known by one single word called ‘manas or antahkaran or inner instruments’. Out of this Indian philosophy gave different names for different functional aspects. We can understand this with the help of a crude example. What coordinated all the sense inputs is called as manas. Like we see hear a sound and immediately we turn our head to see in that direction. What is in us, which said that sound is coming from this direction and we need to look in that direction? This aspect is called as manas. Intellect is the faculty, which analyses the input into us through what we see etc with the help of input from our memory and what is our desire etc.  This is much more subtle function compared to the functioning of mind.</span><br/><br/><span>Question: is there a difference between pranayama done in a sylvan atmosphere   and that done in a highly polluted city granting the room is very clean? If yes does it mean that most public cannot reap full benefit.</span><br/><br/><span>Answer:  Certainly, the quality of air that we breathe is important for our health point of view. Same rule applies in practicing of pranayama also. The practice of pranayama is supposed to help us to reduce the expenditure of prana in our activities, which will be there wherever you practice pranayama. If one can help to find clean atmosphere go for it but if it is not possible then that much bad effect will be there and benefits of pranayama is reduced.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"More Question and Answers / 18th international yoga conference","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-01-02T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":12,"uuid":"79352b16-5027-448b-ba3d-d110b7213086","title":"Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - Chapter 1 SAMĀDHI PĀDA verse 1 & 2","slug":"patanjalis-yoga-sutras-chapter-1-samadhi-pada-verse-1-2","markdown":"<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefJsgAb5I/AAAAAAAAA1I/5wGD3LyeZao/s1600/v1.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"82\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefJsgAb5I/AAAAAAAAA1I/5wGD3LyeZao/s200/v1.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div>\n\n<p><span>English meaning: </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span><em>Now the exposition of yoga</em>&rdquo;</span><br/><span>Listen to Sri NV Raghuramji&rsquo;s satsang on Verse 1: </span><span><strong><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/atha%20yoganusasanam.WAV\">please click on</a></strong></span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><br/><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefMK5oz0I/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ehRLYwtQS1M/s1600/v2.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"78\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefMK5oz0I/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ehRLYwtQS1M/s200/v2.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a> <br/><br/></p>\n<p><span>English meaning: </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span><em>Yoga is the restriction of the fluctuations of mind-stuff</em>&rdquo;</span><span> </span><br/><span>Listen to Sri NV Raghuramji&rsquo;s satsang on Verse 2: </span><strong><span><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Chittavruttinirodha.WAV\">please click on</a>.</span></strong><span> </span><br/><br/><span>To read the Patanjali&rsquo;s Yoga Sutras:</span><br/><span>english translation: </span><a href=\"http://www.gita-society.com/section3/patanjali-yogasutra.pdf\">click for the online copy in pdf format</a><br/><span>turkish translation: </span><a href=\"http://www.yogamerkezi.com/ceviriler/sutra/ysutra.htm\">click for online copy in htm format </a></p>","html":"<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefJsgAb5I/AAAAAAAAA1I/5wGD3LyeZao/s1600/v1.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"82\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefJsgAb5I/AAAAAAAAA1I/5wGD3LyeZao/s200/v1.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a></div>\n\n<p><span>English meaning: </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span><em>Now the exposition of yoga</em>&rdquo;</span><br/><span>Listen to Sri NV Raghuramji&rsquo;s satsang on Verse 1: </span><span><strong><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/atha%20yoganusasanam.WAV\">please click on</a></strong></span><span>.</span></p>  \n\n<p><br/><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefMK5oz0I/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ehRLYwtQS1M/s1600/v2.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"78\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/TIefMK5oz0I/AAAAAAAAA1Q/ehRLYwtQS1M/s200/v2.jpg\" width=\"200\"/></a> <br/><br/></p>  \n\n<p><span>English meaning: </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span><em>Yoga is the restriction of the fluctuations of mind-stuff</em>&rdquo;</span><span> </span><br/><span>Listen to Sri NV Raghuramji&rsquo;s satsang on Verse 2: </span><strong><span><a href=\"http://www.nvraghuram.org/voice_files/Chittavruttinirodha.WAV\">please click on</a>.</span></strong><span> </span><br/><br/><span>To read the Patanjali&rsquo;s Yoga Sutras:</span><br/><span>english translation: </span><a href=\"http://www.gita-society.com/section3/patanjali-yogasutra.pdf\">click for the online copy in pdf format</a><br/><span>turkish translation: </span><a href=\"http://www.yogamerkezi.com/ceviriler/sutra/ysutra.htm\">click for online copy in htm format </a></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Patanjali's Yoga Sutras - Chapter 1 SAMĀDHI PĀDA verse 1 & 2","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-09-08T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-09-08T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-09-08T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":13,"uuid":"05e740cd-11a4-4ad6-8a5d-0356e73f4702","title":"What is Bandhas and difficulties in practicing bandhas","slug":"what-is-bandhas-and-difficulties-in-practicing-bandhas","markdown":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuramji answers the questions:</span><br/><span>1.

Normally speaking once we are human being the impressions of human being on our mind is so strong that any other vasana or the impressions on our mind by the world out side is not so strong as to change the very instrument called human body though which we want to work our may to these vasanas. therefore it is not generally possible to come with different form in the next life. But exceptions are possible because some one has contemplated so strong on some thing else that it has affected the next birth. The famous example is that Jada Bharata though highly sattvic in his final days was living with a deer which has become very dear to him and therefore was so much engrossed in it that he was born as deer in his next life.

Why can&rsquo;t we say that Tagore was not interested in English education but was fascinated by Indian culture. Just like someone is turned off by Indian culture but fascinated by USA culture? I am ok with influence of environment, nurture etc. Is it really self effort or some need in a person trying to express itself whether in English culture or Indian culture? We could explain on the basis of Gunas and Swabhava/Swadharma as in Gita.</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer:</strong><br/></span>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*our actions has the influence of three ingredients. one is the vasana that we carry, the other is the environment and the third is education. the vasana was so strong that he is drawn to the music and art and poetry of Indian life style that the other two did not have lasting or no impact on him. whereas i think other people do not have such a great vasana from previous life that they can be easily drawn by the influence of the environment and upbringing. Especially Tagores parents wanted him to be influenced by the British ways that they sent him to England for his education. But that did not only not change him but he is convinced about the great wealth of Indian thinking. Gunas and Swabhava is more much more deeper aspects of individual like your vasana may be for art and music. but it manifests according to your guna. some people can bing out their talents in rajasic way or aggressively. So in our personality deep inside is the guna over that is samskara and then the particular form like art music or painting etc. some thimes scriptures refer all these together as samskara *</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Where is the &lsquo;free choice&rsquo; in the selection of family or environment after death? A money minded person wants to be born in a rich family. A knowledge seeking person in a suitable environment so on. Does the person selects his family just before death (as some scriptures say that the dying person&rsquo;s next life briefly flashes in his mind and once he makes that choice he will give up the present body etc.) or it happens due to UDANA carrying the mental impressions? In that case UDANA (which is normally considered as JADA) has to be Universal consciousness itself to guide the subtle body or we have to assume some other consciousness guiding vasanas.</span></span>\n<div><strong>Answer:</strong></div>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*Udana is the expression of the fundamental prana which in turn is atman or self or simply saying I! That is choice of this I. This is supposed to be free but this I uses the vasanas as a reason for choosing. since one has the free choice there may be several wombs ready to receive him this I chooses one which suits his requirements. All the time even after the birth the I has choice I can change its tendencies but he uses the influence of environment or education. That is the reason this life is called as Life of Karma where one can bring about change in understanding of life.*</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong><br/></strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">If a person comes with certain vasanas to play them out where do the residue vasanas stay? Who tracks the vasanas associated with current life with Vasanas that are yet to play out which we have forgotten. Are they in Universal memory. What is the link between current memory with Universal memory.</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer.: </strong><br/>*vasanas are there with one self. some find expression and some not because the person did not find an opportunity to manifest. like some people you see appear not have any greed or miserliness for all these years when they do not have much riches. but once they have riches suddenly these qualities surface as if they were never present earlier. This is where the philosophy says they are not newly found but they only found their opportunity to surface into manifestation like after rains suddenly the seeds hidden in the ground sprout!!*</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong><br/></strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">It seems that rebirth theory raises lot of interesting questions and to answer them we have to make new assumptions which we have to take them on faith either as experience from saints or scriptures.</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Alternatively, we could take help from 2nd law of thermo dynamics saying that nothing gets created or destroyed but only changes it forms. But, the total energy is constant. That way way the physical body goes back to 5 elements after death. Mind gets transformed into new mind after death so on.</span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></span></div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*that is true that energy can never be created and nor can be destroyed but the freewill of an individual found in this life is the one which can change it. Udana or samskara are the minor details explaining about the possible process. If we dont have the freewill then it reduces to only matter and nothing else!

It is purely how intensely you have contemplated and became one with that determines.</span></p>  \n\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Question:</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Is it necessary to bring in the concept of vasana to explain the differences in people or their achievements as in the case of Tagore, for example in this article? Why can&rsquo;t we say that Tagore was not interested in English education but was fascinated by Indian culture. Just like someone is turned off by Indian culture but fascinated by USA culture? I am ok with influence of environment, nurture etc. Is it really self effort or some need in a person trying to express itself whether in English culture or Indian culture? We could explain on the basis of Gunas and Swabhava/Swadharma as in Gita.</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer:</strong><br/></span>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*our actions has the influence of three ingredients. one is the vasana that we carry, the other is the environment and the third is education. the vasana was so strong that he is drawn to the music and art and poetry of Indian life style that the other two did not have lasting or no impact on him. whereas i think other people do not have such a great vasana from previous life that they can be easily drawn by the influence of the environment and upbringing. Especially Tagores parents wanted him to be influenced by the British ways that they sent him to England for his education. But that did not only not change him but he is convinced about the great wealth of Indian thinking. Gunas and Swabhava is more much more deeper aspects of individual like your vasana may be for art and music. but it manifests according to your guna. some people can bing out their talents in rajasic way or aggressively. So in our personality deep inside is the guna over that is samskara and then the particular form like art music or painting etc. some thimes scriptures refer all these together as samskara *</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Where is the &lsquo;free choice&rsquo; in the selection of family or environment after death? A money minded person wants to be born in a rich family. A knowledge seeking person in a suitable environment so on. Does the person selects his family just before death (as some scriptures say that the dying person&rsquo;s next life briefly flashes in his mind and once he makes that choice he will give up the present body etc.) or it happens due to UDANA carrying the mental impressions? In that case UDANA (which is normally considered as JADA) has to be Universal consciousness itself to guide the subtle body or we have to assume some other consciousness guiding vasanas.</span></span>  \n<div><strong>Answer:</strong></div>  \n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*Udana is the expression of the fundamental prana which in turn is atman or self or simply saying I! That is choice of this I. This is supposed to be free but this I uses the vasanas as a reason for choosing. since one has the free choice there may be several wombs ready to receive him this I chooses one which suits his requirements. All the time even after the birth the I has choice I can change its tendencies but he uses the influence of environment or education. That is the reason this life is called as Life of Karma where one can bring about change in understanding of life.*</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong><br/></strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">If a person comes with certain vasanas to play them out where do the residue vasanas stay? Who tracks the vasanas associated with current life with Vasanas that are yet to play out which we have forgotten. Are they in Universal memory. What is the link between current memory with Universal memory.</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer.: </strong><br/>*vasanas are there with one self. some find expression and some not because the person did not find an opportunity to manifest. like some people you see appear not have any greed or miserliness for all these years when they do not have much riches. but once they have riches suddenly these qualities surface as if they were never present earlier. This is where the philosophy says they are not newly found but they only found their opportunity to surface into manifestation like after rains suddenly the seeds hidden in the ground sprout!!*</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong><br/></strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Question:</strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">It seems that rebirth theory raises lot of interesting questions and to answer them we have to make new assumptions which we have to take them on faith either as experience from saints or scriptures.</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Alternatively, we could take help from 2nd law of thermo dynamics saying that nothing gets created or destroyed but only changes it forms. But, the total energy is constant. That way way the physical body goes back to 5 elements after death. Mind gets transformed into new mind after death so on.</span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></span></div>  \n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">*that is true that energy can never be created and nor can be destroyed but the freewill of an individual found in this life is the one which can change it. Udana or samskara are the minor details explaining about the possible process. If we dont have the freewill then it reduces to only matter and nothing else! That is teh view of charvakas also saying there is nothing other than matter and follow the laws of matter.*</span></div>  \n</div>  \n\n<p></div></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Questions about \"Predictions as a Science\" from readers","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-07-04T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-07-04T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-07-04T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":17,"uuid":"0112914f-9d09-43fe-8d4b-6d764152d2f6","title":"Bhagavat Gita Talks - Chapter 2 - Sloka 69","slug":"bhagavat-gita-talks-chapter-2-sloka-69","markdown":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuram gives an explanation to the sloka </span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;Yaanishaa sarvabhootaanaam tasyaam jaagarti samyamee; </span><br/><span>Yasyaam jaagrati bhootaani saa nishaa pashyato muneh.&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;That which is night to all beings, then the self-controlled man is awake; </span><br/><span>when all beings are awake, that is night for the sage who sees.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"422\" src=\"http://blip.tv/play/AYHX4X8C.html?p=1\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>","html":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuram gives an explanation to the sloka </span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;Yaanishaa sarvabhootaanaam tasyaam jaagarti samyamee; </span><br/><span>Yasyaam jaagrati bhootaani saa nishaa pashyato muneh.&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;That which is night to all beings, then the self-controlled man is awake; </span><br/><span>when all beings are awake, that is night for the sage who sees.&rdquo;</span></p>  \n\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"422\" src=\"http://blip.tv/play/AYHX4X8C.html?p=1\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Bhagavat Gita Talks - Chapter 2 - Sloka 69","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-04-21T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-04-21T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-04-21T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":18,"uuid":"8e6aaf0e-48c6-4566-a30f-109fb589f5d4","title":"Initiation in Yoga","slug":"initiation-in-yoga","markdown":"<p><span>Part 1</span><br/><span>Sri NV Raghuram answers the questions:</span><br/><span>1.

Especially when we hear in sports, I never liked it at all. Recently I had to give thought to it when my nephew asked me to give some philosophical background about sports.       </div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      Our seers and sages from the Vedic times held non-violence as the highest virtue with one of the most valuable sutra “<em>Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah</em>” . Parama dharma or the supreme reality or principle is creation. I consider anything that leads to destruction as the highest crime. All other virtues are simple virtues or simple dharmas and non-violence is the supreme virtue indicating that if there is any thing, which is directly opposite to creation, it is violence. The very concept of ‘killer instinct’ has the idea of violence at its core. Therefore, killer instinct is a very bad concept and just cannot be promoted however useful and effective and popular it is!       </div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      In the Astanga yoga of Patanjali ‘ahimsa’ or non violence is given the first place. This is the first of five yamas or disciplines that form the prerequisites for the practice of yoga. When Patanjali gave all these practices such as yama, niyama, asana pranayama etc, it was clearly for ones own personal spiritual growth and definitely not with reference to the world outside. I found many speakers and writers talk about violence, as some thing that has reference only to the world out side. When you look at violence and nonviolence with respect to the world out side, it is obviously  a necessary discipline for a smooth functioning of the society. If some one violates these social norms he/she will become punishable. I feel that if we interpret ahimsa only in the context of social harmony it is a very superficial meaning of ahimsa. It becomes most meaningful if we look  at it as a tool for one’s own growth. Just think for a while&mdash; what will be the amount of damage a person inflicts upon himself physically mentally and spiritually if he takes to the course of violence!</div>\n<div align=\"justify\">      <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As soon as we get any thought of violence, it creates a chain of negative reactions in our mind body complex. The mind gets into a state of agitation and the body chemistry gets terribly disturbed. We pour in huge quantities of adrenalin and steroidal chemicals into the blood that can create enormous amount of imbalance in the body. If you are a sensitive person, the damage done to your mind body complex by these thoughts is much more than the effect it can have on the outside. Interestingly for an insensitive person he will not even realize the damage it does. Whether one perceives it or not the damage is done. Therefore, both the faces of violence are terribly dangerous and cannot be promoted for whatever reason. However, sometimes when all others methods designed to bring about the desirable change in the society or the individual fail, harsh, firm and violent methods are to be used. This does not come under the concept of Ahimsa which is a discipline recommended for individual or social health. After all if any one becomes violent towards the society, the state legislation has provided enough protective measures at different levels starting from the police force to the military , the team that protects law and order. That is a part of the social system and no spiritual teaching is necessary to take care of it.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, Indian philosophy prescribes the concept of non-violence basically for protecting your core personality and the idea of external non violence becomes a by-product of this discipline. Since yoga is a system for developing one’s peace of mind, every recommendation is for the sake of self evolution through introspective correction and not with reference to the world around. Several instructions are recommended for the practice of non-violence as a spiritual discipline and it has to be practiced  kaya, vacha manasa—i.e. at mental level  and through words and action. But for any reason if you need to use harshness for correcting  the evil violent forces, then the suggestion by Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita is to use violence or anger with complete mastery only when necessary as a last resort. And  show harshness and violence outside but never have anger within.your words and  action may look violent but never be harsh in the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say ‘hiss’ like a snake when necessary but never bite.</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Coming back to the concept of ‘killer instinct’ that is widely promoted today in competitive games or sports,I strongly feel that this concept is totally against the very philosophy of sports.It is poisonous because this puts the player’s mind also into a killing mode . It makes him contemplate on killing the opponent. With this very posture, we are harming ourselves and the others..</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The contemplation on this thought of ‘killer instinct’ snowballs over time and  the idea goes so deep into ones mind that the person is emotionally charged with the instinct. This preoccupation aoaks in to the system so much, that when he wins he is a killer but when he looses it kills him!  As a result, his whole life is going to be filled with nothing but violence. This same violence shows up in all other activities. </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">You may tell me ‘ok. I agree that this word is not good; this attitude is not good and not very pleasant. But if I give-up this how can I perform in this competitive world! I will become non-active and a non-performer, leave alone winning in a competitive situation. Is there anything else that you can suggest to be a winner without using this cocept of a killer?’Yes. There is a much healthier attitude. ;an attitude in tune with nature; a concept that can never promote violence; an attitude very much in tune with the discipline of ahimsa. This wonderful life enhancing all encompassing spiritually acceptable concept is that of ‘creativity’.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Become an artist .Who is an artist? He is one whose performance is far far away from any thought of violence. He creates a mesmerizing art piece out of a simple piece of canvas and pencil. A sculptor creates a sculpture out of raw wood or stone. He has an ability to see the hidden beauty and the successful outcome that exists in the plain colorless sheet or the rough piece of stone. The final winning performance is already there even before he puts the first stroke. He only sees the master piece of beauty as if hiding behind the canvas. The sculptor approaches the stone as though the final figure is   pleading him to unfold herself. Once Michel-Angelo was passing by a stone shop and found there was a stone lying by the side of the shop. He went to the owner and wanted to </span><a href=\"http://purchase.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">purchase.it</span></a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">. The shop fellow told him ‘why do you want to buy this stone? in fact  I have actually been waiting to get it out of my way .I will only be thankful if you remove it from here. Michel Angelo smiled and said ‘I will show you this stone after an year’ and took that stone. A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper ‘this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone’. The friend could not believe him. A sculptor, an artist, a creator can hear the voice of life from lifeless. He unfolds the beauty hidden and he will bring about the seemingly impossible. For others it may look to be a challenge, a struggle but for the artist it is like an enchanting journey where every moment is a celebration.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every activity can be done in two ways&ndash; one is the way of fighting and the other is the way of creating. A child’s growth is not a fight but it is like unfolding the inner potential. This is ‘creativity’. Even a game that we play can be in a killer’s way or a creative way. When we do this in a killer’s way as I explained earlier, our focus will be on the opponent and if we are in a creative way then our attention will be on self. When we are in killer’s way we will be spoiling our body chemistry with the bad chemicals in our blood stream where as if we are playing in a creative way then we vitalize the system by pouring in health rejuvenating chemicals such as endorphins into our blood stream. In creative way of playing, there is always a rhythm and in a killer’s way there is a fatigue and break down of the system. One who takes the game in a creative way he will be able to appreciate the game whether he is a winner or looser. Then ‘I’ is not important but the game becomes important. Interestingly when the spectators watch the game, they also do not feel that it is a war but it is a graceful artwork beautifully shaped into some thing worth watching. I watch the Indian cricket team playing. Whether the score is high or low we can see that Virendra Sehwag’s play is so graceful and it is more like an art work than a war. Once, in an interview when the interviewer asked him how he could play against one of the tough bowlers, his reply was so innocent that he said ‘I do not play according to the bowler but I look at each ball and according to its merit’. The same case is with Roger Fedrer playing tennis. It is so graceful to see how he merges in the game and handles it so smoothly and gracefully. He seems to forget both himself  and the opponent. This is probably the reason that we do not see him running around like a mad man in the court and lose his energy.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every skill depends on the training you had. The real skill in training is not only the actual learning of the intricate details of the skill but there is something more. It needs a training in converting all activity into an art piece , an a act of creativity. This is the process of shifting the focus from outside to inside. You need to do it from within and not to focus on the outside. The out side is a situation and ability is inside. Situations are inert. You are the vibrant able being facing all situations.The ability to change the situation to move towards success is the process of training; more challenging the situation more the reward of achievement; more the expression of the inbuilt  freedom.  This is the purpose of playing a game or training in nay skill. This ability to express your inner freedom is called ‘karmasu kaushalam’ by Sri Krishna. This is the choice element that is inbuilt into all living systems. This ability is there in every animal too. You can see this in the monkeys in Amazon forest. They jump from one tree to another tree in a highly skilled artistic way. They only assess and decide about the next leap to the next branch. No other thing is in their purview. They simply express their inner ability. You must see how the little ones are trained by the mother monkey. It is obvious to see how natural it is to become skilled if we do not have the hang ups about the targets but just learn to express the inbuilt inner ability. The difference with man and animals is that they do not know that they are skilled but we as humans have the ability to know that I am the wonderful performer and hence can en joy this expression of the nature’s gift. Now can you see how we have moved from violence and killer instinct to become an artist and a joyful performer? You are an achiever because you could process the expression of the nature’s gift – the ability to adapt and tune to the challenging situation that is inbuilt within all of us. This is what Swami Vivekananda meant when he said ‘each soul is potentially free (divine) and the goal is to manifest this freedom within by controlling nature within and without’. You would be the best player if you decide to express this inbuilt ability in the situation of sports; you would be the best scientist if you chose to express this freedom in the field of unraveling the miseries of nature through mathematical formulae; you will tower the world of music if you express this freedom through culturing the muscles of your fingers on a musical instrument or the muscles of the voice box.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now a days, it is unfortunate that we are hearing more and more incidents of shocking incidents of violence amongst big achievers in any field. It is most disheartening to see this happening amongst sportsmen although the philosophy of sports and games is basically to move away from violence and channelize our energies towards comradeship, team spirit, give and take etc. We have been seeing several such incidents such as misbehavior of sports persons with air-hostesses,</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">; U</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">se of banned drugs for enhancing the performance; loose sexual conduct of reputed sports personnel etc. It is not only these social evils. We are seeing several examples of life style related diseases; e.g. we read that a reputed WWF player died of heart attack at the age of 40 years! This is only one example of several hundred early deaths.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another important feature of the ‘killer instinct’ is that it is like Opium. It takes away your awareness; when you get into the attitude of working for unfolding the creativity, you are deeply set in your awareness. It enhances your awareness; it opens up the inner doors towards purity which can only manifest as more and more compassion and non-violence. Every evil is characterized by lack of awareness. All violent emotions essentially benumb your awareness. Killer instinct is the height of anger against the opponent. Whenever we are angry we lose our awareness to the extent that we do not even know that we are angry and violent.</span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sri Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita ‘you must participate in the dharma yuddha ( war to remove the incorrigible unrighteous elements in the society) with full awareness; killing is not the thrust ;  to establish the righteousness in the society is the goal ;we had no choice than to adopt this path of war which we accept is violence; but this is the only way to punish the wicked.; oh! Arjuna, become a warrior with full awareness of the purpose and fight for the goal ; establish  a healthy society; this is your duty as a man belonging to the royal dynasty; this is your dharma; in the process you will only manifest your nature, your freedom to be in tune with divinity; you are not the sinner who kills for selfish achievements ; you have to just tune to your inner being and fight’. </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>\n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When we as human beings are capable of recognizing such wonderful truths, when we are bestowed with these abilities how can we behave like unaware instinctual beings? Fighting is an instinct for survival. Here we are not trying to survive for earning our bread. Excelling in any field does not need a killer instinct; it only needs a change in our mind set; it is a wonderful expression of creativity; excelling is flowering .For a plant to come out of the soil it needs a little effort of violence but flowering is effortless; it is softness; it is joy ; it is enchanting; it spreads fragrance. How can we accept that sportsmen should have killer instinct? Krishna continues –‘You cannot fight the war efficiently if you do not have inner peace. Your skill comes from the peace within and not when you are driven by your emotions’. If war can become efficient n  a war with your peace within why do we have to think that a player should cherish this poison of killer instinct to be successful? This is the basic notional correction that is necessary for mankind today in any field of achievement; let us promote this change in mind set.</span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The degeneration in sports today resulting in misconduct is a manifestation of this concept of ‘killer instinct’ . Let us make sports healthier by changing the mind set and become creative. This will make sportsmen better human beings.</span></strong></div>\n</div>","html":"<div align=\"justify\">      Whenever I heard the phrase ‘killer instinct’, it always used to create ‘not a good feeling’ and made me very uncomfortable but I never thought about it deeply.

I found many speakers and writers talk about violence, as some thing that has reference only to the world out side. When you look at violence and nonviolence with respect to the world out side, it is obviously  a necessary discipline for a smooth functioning of the society. If some one violates these social norms he/she will become punishable. I feel that if we interpret ahimsa only in the context of social harmony it is a very superficial meaning of ahimsa. It becomes most meaningful if we look  at it as a tool for one’s own growth. Just think for a while&mdash; what will be the amount of damage a person inflicts upon himself physically mentally and spiritually if he takes to the course of violence!</div>  \n<div align=\"justify\">      <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As soon as we get any thought of violence, it creates a chain of negative reactions in our mind body complex. The mind gets into a state of agitation and the body chemistry gets terribly disturbed. We pour in huge quantities of adrenalin and steroidal chemicals into the blood that can create enormous amount of imbalance in the body. If you are a sensitive person, the damage done to your mind body complex by these thoughts is much more than the effect it can have on the outside. Interestingly for an insensitive person he will not even realize the damage it does. Whether one perceives it or not the damage is done. Therefore, both the faces of violence are terribly dangerous and cannot be promoted for whatever reason. However, sometimes when all others methods designed to bring about the desirable change in the society or the individual fail, harsh, firm and violent methods are to be used. This does not come under the concept of Ahimsa which is a discipline recommended for individual or social health. After all if any one becomes violent towards the society, the state legislation has provided enough protective measures at different levels starting from the police force to the military , the team that protects law and order. That is a part of the social system and no spiritual teaching is necessary to take care of it.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, Indian philosophy prescribes the concept of non-violence basically for protecting your core personality and the idea of external non violence becomes a by-product of this discipline. Since yoga is a system for developing one’s peace of mind, every recommendation is for the sake of self evolution through introspective correction and not with reference to the world around. Several instructions are recommended for the practice of non-violence as a spiritual discipline and it has to be practiced  kaya, vacha manasa—i.e. at mental level  and through words and action. But for any reason if you need to use harshness for correcting  the evil violent forces, then the suggestion by Sri Krishna in Bhagavadgita is to use violence or anger with complete mastery only when necessary as a last resort. And  show harshness and violence outside but never have anger within.your words and  action may look violent but never be harsh in the mind. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say ‘hiss’ like a snake when necessary but never bite.</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Coming back to the concept of ‘killer instinct’ that is widely promoted today in competitive games or sports,I strongly feel that this concept is totally against the very philosophy of sports.It is poisonous because this puts the player’s mind also into a killing mode . It makes him contemplate on killing the opponent. With this very posture, we are harming ourselves and the others..</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The contemplation on this thought of ‘killer instinct’ snowballs over time and  the idea goes so deep into ones mind that the person is emotionally charged with the instinct. This preoccupation aoaks in to the system so much, that when he wins he is a killer but when he looses it kills him!  As a result, his whole life is going to be filled with nothing but violence. This same violence shows up in all other activities. </span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">You may tell me ‘ok. I agree that this word is not good; this attitude is not good and not very pleasant. But if I give-up this how can I perform in this competitive world! I will become non-active and a non-performer, leave alone winning in a competitive situation. Is there anything else that you can suggest to be a winner without using this cocept of a killer?’Yes. There is a much healthier attitude. ;an attitude in tune with nature; a concept that can never promote violence; an attitude very much in tune with the discipline of ahimsa. This wonderful life enhancing all encompassing spiritually acceptable concept is that of ‘creativity’.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Become an artist .Who is an artist? He is one whose performance is far far away from any thought of violence. He creates a mesmerizing art piece out of a simple piece of canvas and pencil. A sculptor creates a sculpture out of raw wood or stone. He has an ability to see the hidden beauty and the successful outcome that exists in the plain colorless sheet or the rough piece of stone. The final winning performance is already there even before he puts the first stroke. He only sees the master piece of beauty as if hiding behind the canvas. The sculptor approaches the stone as though the final figure is   pleading him to unfold herself. Once Michel-Angelo was passing by a stone shop and found there was a stone lying by the side of the shop. He went to the owner and wanted to </span><a href=\"http://purchase.it/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">purchase.it</span></a><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">. The shop fellow told him ‘why do you want to buy this stone? in fact  I have actually been waiting to get it out of my way .I will only be thankful if you remove it from here. Michel Angelo smiled and said ‘I will show you this stone after an year’ and took that stone. A year later, Michel invited the shopkeeper to a big function which was organized for unveiling a sculpture. Michel told the shop keeper ‘this is the same stone that I brought from your place last year. As I was passing by your shop I heard this beauty asking me to take me and release from the bondage within this hard stone’. The friend could not believe him. A sculptor, an artist, a creator can hear the voice of life from lifeless. He unfolds the beauty hidden and he will bring about the seemingly impossible. For others it may look to be a challenge, a struggle but for the artist it is like an enchanting journey where every moment is a celebration.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every activity can be done in two ways&ndash; one is the way of fighting and the other is the way of creating. A child’s growth is not a fight but it is like unfolding the inner potential. This is ‘creativity’. Even a game that we play can be in a killer’s way or a creative way. When we do this in a killer’s way as I explained earlier, our focus will be on the opponent and if we are in a creative way then our attention will be on self. When we are in killer’s way we will be spoiling our body chemistry with the bad chemicals in our blood stream where as if we are playing in a creative way then we vitalize the system by pouring in health rejuvenating chemicals such as endorphins into our blood stream. In creative way of playing, there is always a rhythm and in a killer’s way there is a fatigue and break down of the system. One who takes the game in a creative way he will be able to appreciate the game whether he is a winner or looser. Then ‘I’ is not important but the game becomes important. Interestingly when the spectators watch the game, they also do not feel that it is a war but it is a graceful artwork beautifully shaped into some thing worth watching. I watch the Indian cricket team playing. Whether the score is high or low we can see that Virendra Sehwag’s play is so graceful and it is more like an art work than a war. Once, in an interview when the interviewer asked him how he could play against one of the tough bowlers, his reply was so innocent that he said ‘I do not play according to the bowler but I look at each ball and according to its merit’. The same case is with Roger Fedrer playing tennis. It is so graceful to see how he merges in the game and handles it so smoothly and gracefully. He seems to forget both himself  and the opponent. This is probably the reason that we do not see him running around like a mad man in the court and lose his energy.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every skill depends on the training you had. The real skill in training is not only the actual learning of the intricate details of the skill but there is something more. It needs a training in converting all activity into an art piece , an a act of creativity. This is the process of shifting the focus from outside to inside. You need to do it from within and not to focus on the outside. The out side is a situation and ability is inside. Situations are inert. You are the vibrant able being facing all situations.The ability to change the situation to move towards success is the process of training; more challenging the situation more the reward of achievement; more the expression of the inbuilt  freedom.  This is the purpose of playing a game or training in nay skill. This ability to express your inner freedom is called ‘karmasu kaushalam’ by Sri Krishna. This is the choice element that is inbuilt into all living systems. This ability is there in every animal too. You can see this in the monkeys in Amazon forest. They jump from one tree to another tree in a highly skilled artistic way. They only assess and decide about the next leap to the next branch. No other thing is in their purview. They simply express their inner ability. You must see how the little ones are trained by the mother monkey. It is obvious to see how natural it is to become skilled if we do not have the hang ups about the targets but just learn to express the inbuilt inner ability. The difference with man and animals is that they do not know that they are skilled but we as humans have the ability to know that I am the wonderful performer and hence can en joy this expression of the nature’s gift. Now can you see how we have moved from violence and killer instinct to become an artist and a joyful performer? You are an achiever because you could process the expression of the nature’s gift – the ability to adapt and tune to the challenging situation that is inbuilt within all of us. This is what Swami Vivekananda meant when he said ‘each soul is potentially free (divine) and the goal is to manifest this freedom within by controlling nature within and without’. You would be the best player if you decide to express this inbuilt ability in the situation of sports; you would be the best scientist if you chose to express this freedom in the field of unraveling the miseries of nature through mathematical formulae; you will tower the world of music if you express this freedom through culturing the muscles of your fingers on a musical instrument or the muscles of the voice box.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now a days, it is unfortunate that we are hearing more and more incidents of shocking incidents of violence amongst big achievers in any field. It is most disheartening to see this happening amongst sportsmen although the philosophy of sports and games is basically to move away from violence and channelize our energies towards comradeship, team spirit, give and take etc. We have been seeing several such incidents such as misbehavior of sports persons with air-hostesses,</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">; U</span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">se of banned drugs for enhancing the performance; loose sexual conduct of reputed sports personnel etc. It is not only these social evils. We are seeing several examples of life style related diseases; e.g. we read that a reputed WWF player died of heart attack at the age of 40 years! This is only one example of several hundred early deaths.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another important feature of the ‘killer instinct’ is that it is like Opium. It takes away your awareness; when you get into the attitude of working for unfolding the creativity, you are deeply set in your awareness. It enhances your awareness; it opens up the inner doors towards purity which can only manifest as more and more compassion and non-violence. Every evil is characterized by lack of awareness. All violent emotions essentially benumb your awareness. Killer instinct is the height of anger against the opponent. Whenever we are angry we lose our awareness to the extent that we do not even know that we are angry and violent.</span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sri Krishna told Arjuna in Bhagavad-Gita ‘you must participate in the dharma yuddha ( war to remove the incorrigible unrighteous elements in the society) with full awareness; killing is not the thrust ;  to establish the righteousness in the society is the goal ;we had no choice than to adopt this path of war which we accept is violence; but this is the only way to punish the wicked.; oh! Arjuna, become a warrior with full awareness of the purpose and fight for the goal ; establish  a healthy society; this is your duty as a man belonging to the royal dynasty; this is your dharma; in the process you will only manifest your nature, your freedom to be in tune with divinity; you are not the sinner who kills for selfish achievements ; you have to just tune to your inner being and fight’. </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> </span></div>  \n<div align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">      </span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When we as human beings are capable of recognizing such wonderful truths, when we are bestowed with these abilities how can we behave like unaware instinctual beings? Fighting is an instinct for survival. Here we are not trying to survive for earning our bread. Excelling in any field does not need a killer instinct; it only needs a change in our mind set; it is a wonderful expression of creativity; excelling is flowering .For a plant to come out of the soil it needs a little effort of violence but flowering is effortless; it is softness; it is joy ; it is enchanting; it spreads fragrance. How can we accept that sportsmen should have killer instinct? Krishna continues –‘You cannot fight the war efficiently if you do not have inner peace. Your skill comes from the peace within and not when you are driven by your emotions’. If war can become efficient n  a war with your peace within why do we have to think that a player should cherish this poison of killer instinct to be successful? This is the basic notional correction that is necessary for mankind today in any field of achievement; let us promote this change in mind set.</span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span><br/><div align=\"center\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The degeneration in sports today resulting in misconduct is a manifestation of this concept of ‘killer instinct’ . Let us make sports healthier by changing the mind set and become creative. This will make sportsmen better human beings.</span></strong></div>  \n</div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Creativity or Killer Instinct?","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-03-04T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":21,"uuid":"19bc0dbb-e9a8-4314-acc1-a03cd48e69d2","title":"What is Ahimsa - Non-violence","slug":"what-is-ahimsa-non-violence","markdown":"<p><span>Questions answered in 4 parts:</span><br/><br/><span>Part 1 :</span><br/><span>1.

Let us understand these complexities one by one.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">It may be too premature to decide that these phenomena are totally accidental. Sages said that these talents were there in the unmanifest in the form of possibilities, and are ready to manifest at the right time. Let us try to understand what this means. What is this unmanifest? What did the sages mean by manifesting it when the suitable time comes?. The Indian philosophy explained such phenomena (child prodigy) by proposing the concept of rebirth. The child who shows some extra ordinary talent in music must have been a very devoted student of classical music in the previous birth and this music has gone so deep into the person’s personality that he or she carries the music through the soul. This soul (sukshma sharira) while migrating after death into the next body carries this coded impression of the musical talent. This shows the extra ordinary relationship of the person with the music. This child must have nourished music close to her heart and spent all her life in music during her previous life which has entered into the present life. It is her investment through intense love for music that has given her this talent right from birth in this life. This knowledge from the scriptures helps us to realize that our life here is not a beginning and end all but it is a very small portion of a long journey. This applies not only to an art or music or an extraordinary phenomenon but it refers to each and every small thing that has shaped our personality and behaviour in every walk of life! Once we understand and experience this fact it makes us lot more responsible and cautious about any thing we do (good or bad) during this life which may leave us with a strong impression for the next life. Though we have many more desires to do or to achieve etc we don’t have a fitting instrument called body mind complex at the time of death we come back with new instrument called body mind complex with the whole idea of finishing the unfinished agenda. These unfinished desires and other things called as vasana and they are the cause for our rebirth or reincarnation l</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The understanding of reincarnation makes you realize that you are not just what you are now. This present life is only a link in the continuum of your existence in this creation. Let me explain this a little more. Let us see what you mean by your ‘birth day’ which you celebrate with such great importance. It is just the day you came out of your mother’s womb and the people around saw. the baby with their eyes. Did you really come into existence on that day? You know that this so called ‘date of birth’ is only for relating it to the record of the world outside. This has very little to do with your original date of birth. You give so much importance to this date and celebrate year after year, although you know very clearly that you were there for 9 months in mother’s womb before coming out. From the womb if you go further back, you were there in the sperm of the father and the ovum of the mother. Take it further back. The scriptures say that all your faculties, fears, desires, etc that made you an unique personality were there in the form of coded impressions(</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">karmas</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">) in the soul (</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">sukshma sharira)</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> that left the previous body. This is the unmanifest seed in the subtle world that carries accumulated impressions (</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">sanskaras</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">) from several lives before. The scriptures go on to say that you chose to be born in this family culture because you wanted the congenial atmosphere to manifest those qualities during this life. The family that nurtured you gave you all the background nutrition through generations of the value systems and traditions. In fact we can see that this choice is reflected even in the physical features as genetic coding that determines the shape of the nose or color of the hair etc.. For example if your intense desire was to become a film actress you will chose a family of beautiful people and not ugly people. This shows up at the time of birth itself as physical features of the baby and its mannerisms. We say ‘wow, the baby is so tall, pretty with long fingers and toes and blue eyes she will become an actress like her great grand mum’.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we may now say that this nature’s law is</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">: Large number of unique abilities are there in the unmanifest, in the form of possibilities, and are ready to manifest at the right time. These are in the form of very strong possibilities only and we need to make them manifest through our efforts. If we fail in our efforts, then it can not express itself’. In this process besides our self effort to actualize there are other factors which are environmental etc.</span></em></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Environment and nurture</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now let us consider the contribution of the environment to the component of ‘nurture’. The place you grow, the people around, the values of your parents seeded into you is necessary to shape you up. That is why it is said that we are in a web of life. In this web of life we are even connected with the planets and stars etc, to some degree or the other. Though all these effects are there from various forces one most important primary force which is responsible for our journey is the self effort which is one’s own will power. If one has a strong will power then all ‘like forces’ join hands and help him in that direction and he can resist the ‘opposing forces’. On the other hand if one has a weak will power other forces will drag him in all other directions.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Rabindranath Tagore’s father wanted to protect the child from the influence of the Indian surroundings right from his early childhood. He wanted him to be influenced by the British ways. He engaged special teachers to teach him at home and when it did not work out he sent him to England to educate him under strict supervision. But Tagore’s will power was so strong once he came back from England he went back to his original interest. The love for nature and poetry that was suppressed for a long time found its expression. He started writing poetry, which was not the liking of his father at all. The father wanted him to be a scientist and not an artist. But what was the result? Tagore became a great a poet to be rewarded with a noble prize. Thus we see how a strong will power can resist any outside force. In Tagore’s case we can see the play of all the factors we have mentioned until now. (a) He had the seed of becoming a great poet from his previous birth (b) his jiva (soul)chose to be born in this family because it needed the congenial environment of nurture that included the atmosphere of a rich Indian Bengali family full of soft emotions along with the strong will power and intelligence of the father (although he did not use them to grow the way the father wanted) &copy; the stay in England helped him to obtain the British training in hard work, punctuality, meticulousness and mastery over English language and (d) the strong will power to achieve excellence. Thus he could flower out fully when all these aspects came together i.e. the basic poetic tendency from his previous birth, the strong will power of the father, the soft emotions from the mother and Bengali state culture, and the training in British culture and English language.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">- to be continued&hellip;</span></em></span></p>","html":"<p align=\"justify\"><span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Concept of Reincarnation as a science</span></em></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">There are several factors that are involved in understanding this higher law of nature.

This applies not only to an art or music or an extraordinary phenomenon but it refers to each and every small thing that has shaped our personality and behaviour in every walk of life! Once we understand and experience this fact it makes us lot more responsible and cautious about any thing we do (good or bad) during this life which may leave us with a strong impression for the next life. Though we have many more desires to do or to achieve etc we don’t have a fitting instrument called body mind complex at the time of death we come back with new instrument called body mind complex with the whole idea of finishing the unfinished agenda. These unfinished desires and other things called as vasana and they are the cause for our rebirth or reincarnation l</span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The understanding of reincarnation makes you realize that you are not just what you are now. This present life is only a link in the continuum of your existence in this creation. Let me explain this a little more. Let us see what you mean by your ‘birth day’ which you celebrate with such great importance. It is just the day you came out of your mother’s womb and the people around saw. the baby with their eyes. Did you really come into existence on that day? You know that this so called ‘date of birth’ is only for relating it to the record of the world outside. This has very little to do with your original date of birth. You give so much importance to this date and celebrate year after year, although you know very clearly that you were there for 9 months in mother’s womb before coming out. From the womb if you go further back, you were there in the sperm of the father and the ovum of the mother. Take it further back. The scriptures say that all your faculties, fears, desires, etc that made you an unique personality were there in the form of coded impressions(</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">karmas</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">) in the soul (</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">sukshma sharira)</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> that left the previous body. This is the unmanifest seed in the subtle world that carries accumulated impressions (</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">sanskaras</span></em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">) from several lives before. The scriptures go on to say that you chose to be born in this family culture because you wanted the congenial atmosphere to manifest those qualities during this life. The family that nurtured you gave you all the background nutrition through generations of the value systems and traditions. In fact we can see that this choice is reflected even in the physical features as genetic coding that determines the shape of the nose or color of the hair etc.. For example if your intense desire was to become a film actress you will chose a family of beautiful people and not ugly people. This shows up at the time of birth itself as physical features of the baby and its mannerisms. We say ‘wow, the baby is so tall, pretty with long fingers and toes and blue eyes she will become an actress like her great grand mum’.</span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we may now say that this nature’s law is</span><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">: Large number of unique abilities are there in the unmanifest, in the form of possibilities, and are ready to manifest at the right time. These are in the form of very strong possibilities only and we need to make them manifest through our efforts. If we fail in our efforts, then it can not express itself’. In this process besides our self effort to actualize there are other factors which are environmental etc.</span></em></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Environment and nurture</span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Now let us consider the contribution of the environment to the component of ‘nurture’. The place you grow, the people around, the values of your parents seeded into you is necessary to shape you up. That is why it is said that we are in a web of life. In this web of life we are even connected with the planets and stars etc, to some degree or the other. Though all these effects are there from various forces one most important primary force which is responsible for our journey is the self effort which is one’s own will power. If one has a strong will power then all ‘like forces’ join hands and help him in that direction and he can resist the ‘opposing forces’. On the other hand if one has a weak will power other forces will drag him in all other directions.</span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Rabindranath Tagore’s father wanted to protect the child from the influence of the Indian surroundings right from his early childhood. He wanted him to be influenced by the British ways. He engaged special teachers to teach him at home and when it did not work out he sent him to England to educate him under strict supervision. But Tagore’s will power was so strong once he came back from England he went back to his original interest. The love for nature and poetry that was suppressed for a long time found its expression. He started writing poetry, which was not the liking of his father at all. The father wanted him to be a scientist and not an artist. But what was the result? Tagore became a great a poet to be rewarded with a noble prize. Thus we see how a strong will power can resist any outside force. In Tagore’s case we can see the play of all the factors we have mentioned until now. (a) He had the seed of becoming a great poet from his previous birth (b) his jiva (soul)chose to be born in this family because it needed the congenial environment of nurture that included the atmosphere of a rich Indian Bengali family full of soft emotions along with the strong will power and intelligence of the father (although he did not use them to grow the way the father wanted) &copy; the stay in England helped him to obtain the British training in hard work, punctuality, meticulousness and mastery over English language and (d) the strong will power to achieve excellence. Thus he could flower out fully when all these aspects came together i.e. the basic poetic tendency from his previous birth, the strong will power of the father, the soft emotions from the mother and Bengali state culture, and the training in British culture and English language.</span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">- to be continued&hellip;</span></em></span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Predictions as a Science -2-","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-06-29T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-06-29T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-06-29T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":24,"uuid":"5da862aa-97e5-4442-a879-58a9ab0125e6","title":"Significance of Chakras in Spiritual Path","slug":"significance-of-chakras-in-spiritual-path","markdown":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuramji gives answers to the questions below: </span><br/><span>how many chakras do we have?</span><br/><span>how to know whether chakras are working properly?</span><br/><span>feeling chakras show spiritual advancement?</span><br/><span>can feeling chakras be an obstacle on spiritual path? </span></p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MgvTxYWas0g?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","html":"<p><span>Sri NV Raghuramji gives answers to the questions below: </span><br/><span>how many chakras do we have?</span><br/><span>how to know whether chakras are working properly?</span><br/><span>feeling chakras show spiritual advancement?</span><br/><span>can feeling chakras be an obstacle on spiritual path? </span></p>  \n\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MgvTxYWas0g?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"450\"></iframe></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Significance of Chakras in Spiritual Path","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-01-29T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-01-29T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-01-29T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":25,"uuid":"e8237c30-193b-49fc-8261-146da83f169c","title":"Mail to Raghuramji and Nagendraji regarding Lalitaji's lefting her body","slug":"mail-to-raghuramji-and-nagendraji-regarding-lalitajis-lefting-her-body","markdown":"<div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">We are all affected by the vacuum of elders . one generation of elders in the VYASA family gone.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\">she was 87, ailing for some time, was very sad after aunti went, was praying - in fact fighting with devi saraswati ( her ishta devata) daily to take her away; is it not confrting to know that she left ehr body without an iota of suffering?

For example all fluids follow the laws of fluid mechanics, solids follow some specific rules and gases follow gas law etc. Then there are some exceptions to these rules in nature. The exceptions are there to prove the rules. They do not violate the rules. For example we know mercury is solid but it does not follow the properties of solid this is an exception. In similar fashion in human beings also there are natures’ laws but there can be exceptions!</span><br/><br/><span>What are these Exceptions?</span><br/><span>Recently I was watching a blog in which a 3 year old child was giving a performance to a huge audience of more than a thousand music lovers and music pundits in Chennai. The anchor, highly talented in music would sing a raga (a traditional classical Indian musical note) and in less than a minute the child would identify the name of the raga and would give accurate technical details of the characteristics and even the exceptions that characterizes that particular raga. Not even on a single occasion the girl never faltered! These are child prodigies. We had a similar child prodigy in our house. My cousin’s son had a very unusual mathematical brain. He was only three years old. You give him any date which may be more than hundred years ago, within seconds he would tell you the name of the corresponding day of week. We would keep very old calendars and play with him! How do we explain this phenomenon? One can say that these things are some accidental neurological aberrations. Is this really an accident in nature? This may be a very sophisticated terminology but by saying so we have not explained any thing; we are only saying that we do not know what is happening! Is there any model or logical explanation that is available to explain such exceptions? Can this model help in predicting such phenomena? Is there a different set of laws for these phenomena? What is the nature of this unmanifest? These are all questions that are addressed in Indian scriptures. The answers and models were revelations during intense meditation. Several researchers went on adding to the knowledge base. These revelations dawned on them when they could go beyond the intellect and tune themselves to higher laws of nature. Such rare insights are possible even today if you can go into such deep meditative states.</span><br/><br/><span>Self effort vs genes</span><br/><span>We can see such unusual talents happening not only in case of music but in so many other areas. Let us take the example of sports. We watch great talents in people like Diago Maradona in football or Tiger Wood in golf or Tendulkar in cricket. When one watches them play we can see the beauty in their game .You feel that this is not mere training that made them such a great genius. If a football dances on is foot all the time in case of Maradona, tiger wood has such a powerful eyes that hundreds of yards he can hit the golf ball to go directly in to the hole and for Tendulkar there is no bowler whose balls are not punished We say, ‘wow! He is a born genius’! What are the common features and what are the differences between the prodigal girl and these genius players? In the case of the girl the genetic talent has revealed itself later in life at a tiny age and in case of the players the talent manifested after going through a formal training in sports. But there are also several players who have undergone similar or much more rigorous training. But not all can become great sportsmen or musicians with training alone. The genetic tendency that is carried over helps one to manifest it through training. Thus the genetic tendencies that are carried over from the previous birth may manifest right from birth or it may need more training to unfold itself. Thus we see that there are two aspects in any performance: the nature and nurture. The nurture or the training makes the nature (the genetic tendency) manifest itself to create a genius. And they show up as the miracles of creation!</span><br/><br/><span>In these singers or artists or players, even though they had extraordinary talents they had to put in their efforts to actualize the possibilities. A gifted singer like Lata Mangeshkar had to put in an enormous amount of sadhana before she became famous even though there was an inborn talent. When we look at this way, we can understand that there must have been so many more people, who had the possibility to manifest their extra ordinary talents but they would have remained as ordinary people. The talent that is hidden in them found no avenue and has no chance of flowering. This is simply because they did not put in the necessary effort to flower out. In many cases we find that the parental pressure in trying to put the child in the so called right path becomes so strong that it would have put them off and undermined their talents! Every flower that is on the mango tree has all the ingredients to become wonderful fruit! Every seed has a tree in it but how many seeds actually become trees? Only those seeds which got the right nurture right from the time they fell from the tree can bring out the tree hidden in it. The factors are too many- the time of falling, the ground, the water, the nutrition, the weather, the fauna around, animals around etc. If the factors involved in unfolding a tree (that has no free will and is completely programmed) to its beauty is so complex , think of how many factors (environmental ,social and self effort) will be necessary for a human seed which is endowed with free will to manifest its talents!.</span><br/><br/><span>In these two examples we saw the talents that are possible in normal people but show up in an extraordinary way in prodigies or geniuses. But there are some unusual talents such as paranormal powers which appear to defy the nature’s laws completely because a normal person just cannot perform such feats. I have a good friend of mine Mr. GS who has amazing ability for psychokinesis. He can show all the feats that we see in a magic show right in front of your eyes without any stage arrangements. One day we were having a casual chat on philosophy over a cup of tea and he just picked up the fork from the table and by looking at it in a focused way he bent it as if it was made of a flexible wire. Bending spoons and forks and keys is a very simple feat that he can demonstrate apart from moving objects as if he has a remote control button in his hands.

Whether they are ordinary powers which can appear like extra ordinary talents, or some kind of special abilities, both of them are part of creation which fall under the category of exceptions but they have nothing to do with spirituality. But it will be interesting to further understand them with reference to factors involving our lives.</span><br/><br/><span>- to be continued&hellip;<br/></span></p>","html":"<p><span>In the nature there are natural laws or rules and most common phenomena follow these laws. For example all fluids follow the laws of fluid mechanics, solids follow some specific rules and gases follow gas law etc. Then there are some exceptions to these rules in nature. The exceptions are there to prove the rules. They do not violate the rules. For example we know mercury is solid but it does not follow the properties of solid this is an exception. In similar fashion in human beings also there are natures’ laws but there can be exceptions!</span><br/><br/><span>What are these Exceptions?</span><br/><span>Recently I was watching a blog in which a 3 year old child was giving a performance to a huge audience of more than a thousand music lovers and music pundits in Chennai. The anchor, highly talented in music would sing a raga (a traditional classical Indian musical note) and in less than a minute the child would identify the name of the raga and would give accurate technical details of the characteristics and even the exceptions that characterizes that particular raga. Not even on a single occasion the girl never faltered! These are child prodigies. We had a similar child prodigy in our house. My cousin’s son had a very unusual mathematical brain. He was only three years old. You give him any date which may be more than hundred years ago, within seconds he would tell you the name of the corresponding day of week. We would keep very old calendars and play with him! How do we explain this phenomenon? One can say that these things are some accidental neurological aberrations. Is this really an accident in nature? This may be a very sophisticated terminology but by saying so we have not explained any thing; we are only saying that we do not know what is happening! Is there any model or logical explanation that is available to explain such exceptions? Can this model help in predicting such phenomena? Is there a different set of laws for these phenomena? What is the nature of this unmanifest? These are all questions that are addressed in Indian scriptures. The answers and models were revelations during intense meditation. Several researchers went on adding to the knowledge base. These revelations dawned on them when they could go beyond the intellect and tune themselves to higher laws of nature. Such rare insights are possible even today if you can go into such deep meditative states.</span><br/><br/><span>Self effort vs genes</span><br/><span>We can see such unusual talents happening not only in case of music but in so many other areas. Let us take the example of sports. We watch great talents in people like Diago Maradona in football or Tiger Wood in golf or Tendulkar in cricket. When one watches them play we can see the beauty in their game .You feel that this is not mere training that made them such a great genius. If a football dances on is foot all the time in case of Maradona, tiger wood has such a powerful eyes that hundreds of yards he can hit the golf ball to go directly in to the hole and for Tendulkar there is no bowler whose balls are not punished We say, ‘wow! He is a born genius’! What are the common features and what are the differences between the prodigal girl and these genius players? In the case of the girl the genetic talent has revealed itself later in life at a tiny age and in case of the players the talent manifested after going through a formal training in sports. But there are also several players who have undergone similar or much more rigorous training. But not all can become great sportsmen or musicians with training alone. The genetic tendency that is carried over helps one to manifest it through training. Thus the genetic tendencies that are carried over from the previous birth may manifest right from birth or it may need more training to unfold itself. Thus we see that there are two aspects in any performance: the nature and nurture. The nurture or the training makes the nature (the genetic tendency) manifest itself to create a genius. And they show up as the miracles of creation!</span><br/><br/><span>In these singers or artists or players, even though they had extraordinary talents they had to put in their efforts to actualize the possibilities. A gifted singer like Lata Mangeshkar had to put in an enormous amount of sadhana before she became famous even though there was an inborn talent. When we look at this way, we can understand that there must have been so many more people, who had the possibility to manifest their extra ordinary talents but they would have remained as ordinary people. The talent that is hidden in them found no avenue and has no chance of flowering. This is simply because they did not put in the necessary effort to flower out. In many cases we find that the parental pressure in trying to put the child in the so called right path becomes so strong that it would have put them off and undermined their talents! Every flower that is on the mango tree has all the ingredients to become wonderful fruit! Every seed has a tree in it but how many seeds actually become trees? Only those seeds which got the right nurture right from the time they fell from the tree can bring out the tree hidden in it. The factors are too many- the time of falling, the ground, the water, the nutrition, the weather, the fauna around, animals around etc. If the factors involved in unfolding a tree (that has no free will and is completely programmed) to its beauty is so complex , think of how many factors (environmental ,social and self effort) will be necessary for a human seed which is endowed with free will to manifest its talents!.</span><br/><br/><span>In these two examples we saw the talents that are possible in normal people but show up in an extraordinary way in prodigies or geniuses. But there are some unusual talents such as paranormal powers which appear to defy the nature’s laws completely because a normal person just cannot perform such feats. I have a good friend of mine Mr. GS who has amazing ability for psychokinesis. He can show all the feats that we see in a magic show right in front of your eyes without any stage arrangements. One day we were having a casual chat on philosophy over a cup of tea and he just picked up the fork from the table and by looking at it in a focused way he bent it as if it was made of a flexible wire. Bending spoons and forks and keys is a very simple feat that he can demonstrate apart from moving objects as if he has a remote control button in his hands. Though he can perform all these things GS is such a simple and honest person that he says that these are the special abilities that he discovered and he has been able to improve upon them by repeated practice. He told that one day when he was a kid he looked at the spoon intensely and it could bend! He says ‘in my teens when I discovered this unusual talent within me I had a great temptation to exploit this talent and declare that I am a God’s messenger and can demonstrate God’s miracles .But thank God I did not cheat people by yielding to my adolescent temptation’.</span><br/><br/><span>He went into true path of spirituality to understand reality and is deeply involved in meditation and doing good to people.

We are all born with wonderful soft emotions. Every child even at the age of two days looks at your face and gives a wonderful smile. In fact, the intellect is born not yet born in the child. It develops much later, maybe after one or two years of being in this world and interacting with this world. That is why Indian philosophy says we are all born with emotions and intellect is what the world gives us. We have other soft emotions like compassion and the sense of wonder along with love. </span><br/><span>Every child is born with that sense of wonder. When you look at the child eyes you can find that, whatever the child is looking at, you would notice that sense of wonder. We were also born with love compassion and sense of wonder. When the child smiles, there is not reason behind it, whereas, as we grow up we have lost that smile on our face. Today if some one smiles, we start to wonder why he is smiling. That means our smile and other soft emotions are buried under our intellect. Now, opposite of this soft emotions like love compassion and sense of appreciation we have violent emotions like anger, hatred, and jealousy. Often people think that not only soft emotions but also violent emotions are also spontaneous. We have these two emotions – one set is soft emotions like love, compassion and sense of wonder, on the other side there are violent emotions like anger, hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Both appear to be spontaneous but they are not. The feeling of love comes spontaneously; the feeling of compassion comes spontaneously. Spontaneous means that which does not require any reason to be. On the other hand, anger, hatred, jealousy, and selfishness are not spontaneous. </span><br/><span>Anger comes up because he did not do the way that ‘I’ wanted it to be done. Greed comes because he has it and ‘I’ don’t have it and that is why ‘I’ am greedy. Hatred comes because he did not behave the way that ‘I’ wanted him to behave so I hate him. You can see that every violent emotion is born out of that ‘I’ which is very important. Whenever one is in soft emotions, this ego is dissolved but when one is in violent emotions, this ego is very important. The most important form of this ego is attachment. Wherever this attachment is, there it leads us into anxiety. The mind becomes restless, and the restlessness results into uncertainty and further leads to anxiety. When the same ego further deepens into us, it leads us into confusion. And this confusion continued for a long time leads us into depression. When you look at whether it is depression or confusion, the deep routed problem is ego. Today most of our sickness is born out of mental disturbances. Yoga is a technique and a state of peace of mind. Peace of mind is our own nature. </span><br/><span>Unfortunately, in the world today we have come away from our nature due to our ignorance and due to the influence of the world around us which has no education to go back to our nature. By developing the inner self control and discipline, we can go back to our nature and this is called Raja Yoga. The method of self sacrifice is called Karma Yoga to go to that same inner peace. By using the self analysis at the intellectual level, it is called Jnana Yoga. The problem which gives rise to disturbances of our mind as looked at from the angle of Bhakti Yoga is this ego or I. by becoming humble and surrendering this ego out of love, we can go to the state of satisfaction or love. Thus, the essential practice of Bhakti Yoga is to dissolve this ego. Now the most important aspect of Bhakti yoga is not to find god but to dissolve our ego. Whenever we are in the experience of soft emotions like love and compassion then with out any effort from our side we find our ego is dissolved. In love, our consciousness rises far above the level of ego. At that point-of-time, our experience is blissful. </span><br/><span>In day to day life, there are two different occasions, when the ego is dissolved and one is resting in self. One experience is when one is in the state of love and the other is in the deep sleep state. When one is in the state of love, then ‘I’ is not important but the other is important. The moment one is in the state of love the other’s comfort becomes more important than of oneself. Normal experience in the world is we take something and we get happiness. On the other hand, when one is in the state of love, comfort of oneself is not giving comfort but the others comfort is giving comfort. The same is the case with compassion. When you are in the state of compassion, you would like to see that the other person is in the state of comfort at the cost of your own discomfort. Therefore in the soft emotions the ego is completely dissolved. And in these soft emotional states, you are very comfortable and very blissful. Similarly, another state where you have absolutely no ego, which is the deep sleep state. While you are in the deep sleep state, you know nothing because you are not there. </span><br/><span>Therefore, the experience of happiness is there when the ego is dissolved. But later on the moment the ego comes up then the soft emotions get corrupted. Ego is like cancer. It poisons the love into lust. You have something which you appreciate but the moment ego come up then it turn into possession. Whenever you are in the experience of soft emotions, you become expansive and slow. Ego is of the nature of constriction and speed. This speed and constriction you can recognize in all the violent emotions like hatred and jealousy, selfishness etc. Another very important point is that these soft emotions give us health but violent emotions give us sickness. Love and compassion give us happiness where as jealousy and hatred gives unhappiness. Often people advice don’t be angry don’t be jealous. Anger and hatred are only outer manifestations but the cause is always ego which is deeply hidden behind. If we don’t want to give up ego but want to give up anger and jealousy it will not be possible. </span><br/><span>If you don’t give up ego but we want to give up the anger all that we do is to suppress the anger. Bhakti Yoga is not about suppressing anger, hatred, or jealousy but it is to get dissolved. Surrender the ego. Often, people wonder how and where to surrender the ego. In the world, we cannot surrender ego to somebody else because that person also had ego. That is why Bhakti Yoga says, think of god, and surrender your ego to god. People have all kinds of questions such as, does god exist, is he taking care of us and where is he.</span><br/><br/><em>-to be continued</em></p>","html":"<p><span>It is important because it deals with our emotions.

Often people understand that ‘Bhagavad’ means said by god but I feel that it is more meaningful to say ‘divine’ knowledge. You may question why do I call it as divine knowledge and what is non divine knowledge? Is all non divine knowledge bad? What is the difference between ordinary knowledge and divine knowledge? What is that knowledge which is ‘bad non divine’ knowledge and what is ‘good non divine’ knowledge? Even to deceive some one and to cheat some one it requires knowledge and we can find people who can be experts in that and they are not only smart in doing so but they can also make it appear right to do that way. All this belong to the category of bad and non divine knowledge. Ordinary or non divine knowledge always deals with right and wrong good and bad and in the language of duality and further it will advice you to do right, and not to do wrong. This is an important knowledge in a society where people are not following right and following wrong! This knowledge given in Bhagavad-Gita is not a knowledge that talks about duality. This is not a kind of a text that tells us that what is right and what is wrong and do right always and not wrong. In order to tell this we don’t need a text like Gita. A simple book of law is sufficient. A book like Gita is one which must be giving us the knowledge of higher dimension. We will know more about this knowledge when we go into the understanding of this subject matter.</span><br/><span>The episode of Gita in the historical event of Mahabharata has happened 5100 years ago. It is a discussion that goes on between Krishna and Arjuna in the battlefield where Krishna is a wise person and Arjuna is a confused person. The whole philosophy of yoga followed and taught is influenced by the teaching of Bhagavad-Gita that if you would have gone to our center Prashanti, you would see this statue there of Bhagavad-Gita.</span><br/><span>Gita is part of a big book called Mahabharata. It is written by a sage called Veda Vyasa. The gist of the story is that, war that took place between the good and bad people. The good people are Pandavas and Arjuna is their leader in the war. The bad people are Kauravas and the leader is Duryadhana. In fact, it is very interesting that in all our lives there are several situations where we have a freedom whether to do right or to do wrong. For example, let us see the act called telling truth or untruth. Maybe we come across several situations where we can tell the truth but we can also tell the lie. Such situations would be there. We come across several situations in life where we can be helpful to others and we can hurt others. In that way life offers several situations, where we can do right and do wrong too. Many situations we chose the side of right. But many times, we also chose the directions of wrong. If you ask yourself then why did we take the side of wrong, we know very clearly it is all because we have inner weakness. The greatness of Arjuna was that every situation that he could take the side of right or wrong and he always chose the side of right. That means Arjuna is good by very choice. On the other side, we have Duryodhana who always chose the side of wrong. To cut the long story short let us come to the situation that the war is taking place between Pandavas and Kauravas and Arjuna is the leader of Pandavas and Duryodhana who is on the side of wrong. Another interesting aspect is that these bad people Duryodhana and others are also cousins and relatives of Arjuna. </span><br/><span>When Arjuna came to the battlefield to fight the war, he saw his cousins and relatives on the other side waiting to fight the war. When he saw his own people on the other side, he has a doubt or confusion as follows. If he fights this war, he will be killing his own people. On one side, he is here to fight the battle and on the other side if he is fighting, he has to kill his own cousins and relatives. He tells Krishna, “Why should I fight this war where I know I am going to rule the kingdom which is drenched by the blood of my own people. I don’t want this war, I don’t want to kill people let me run away into the forest”. So on one side his mind says to fight the war and on the other side, another part the mind says, ‘don’t fight the war’. Whether he should fight the war or he should go the forest and meditate, he was not able to decide and had confusion. </span><br/><span>The confusion whether to fight the war or not has happened to Arjuna but not for Duryodhana. Duryodhana was a bad person but he did not have any problem in fighting the war but Arjuna who was goodness personified, had a problem fighting the war. Bhagavad Gita is a message given to Arjuna who is a good, and not Duryodhana who is the bad person. Arjuna was already right and therefore this message of Bhagavad-Gita can not be a message asking him to do right. This message therefore must be higher than good and bad. That is the reasons why, this knowledge is a divine knowledge higher than the pairs of opposites like right and wrong. When you try to look at Arjuna, who tried to go to the forest and meditate, it appears, similar to the situation of Buddha who also wanted to go to the forest and meditate. When you closely watch there is a lot of difference between Arjuna and Buddha. Buddha was truly interested in peace and wanted to mediate to go to peace. Buddha had no sort of confusion in his mind. On the other hand, Arjuna had confusion in his mind. Arjuna’s confusion is because his interest in not in peace. His question was, ‘should I kill my own people for the sake of winning the war. It is not that he in not interested in the war but he is not interested in war with his own people. He has no hesitation to fight the war if the people in front were not his own people. Whole life he is trained to fight the war, he is educated to fight the war, and he is always the best student in the school at the time of learning and now he came here to fight the war. So in principle he has no aversion for war. All his aversion is of fighting a war against his own people. Therefore, his interest is not in peace like Buddha’s interest, but his interest really is in not killing his own people. To say ‘my’ people, ‘my’ relatives, ‘my’ kingdom etc, are all ‘my’ - attachments. It is this attachment, which brings about this confusion or despondency. Which is given in the first chapter is the Gita. And the whole message of Gita that Krishna gives is to see that this mental depression of Arjuna is removed. To remove this mental disturbance, the technology, the methodology used, is called yoga. The scope of yoga is far more than just doing some physical postures and Pranayama practices. Though, all the chapters and slokas in Bhagavad-Gita Krishna tried to convey the idea of peace of mind and mastery over mind, there are some chapters that are concentrated especially on some particular topic of yoga. How we can bring about the concept of peace of mind in the work that we do is given in the third chapter called karma yoga. Human being has wonderful tool called the intellect and all the development we see is due to the intellect. Using this intellect to go to the peace of mind is given in the fifth chapter called Jnana yoga. The sixth chapter is giving the method of discipline called the Raja yoga. Of all the chapters the smallest and the simplest is twelfth chapter, where Krishna gives the method in which we use emotions to go to peace of mind and this is called, the Bhakti Yoga. Bhakti Yoga is the most important chapter, and it is the point of discussion for today.</span><br/><br/><em>-to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><span>Bhakti Yoga Seminar in Nagoya/Japan </span><br/><span>November 21, 2007</span><br/><br/><span>I bring the greetings from the Vivekananda yoga university, Prashanti Bengaluru</span><br/><span>for all the people interested in the field of yoga, one very important text on the philosophy of yoga is Bhagavad-Gita. ‘Bhagavad’ means divine and Gita is poetry.

We come across several situations in life where we can be helpful to others and we can hurt others. In that way life offers several situations, where we can do right and do wrong too. Many situations we chose the side of right. But many times, we also chose the directions of wrong. If you ask yourself then why did we take the side of wrong, we know very clearly it is all because we have inner weakness. The greatness of Arjuna was that every situation that he could take the side of right or wrong and he always chose the side of right. That means Arjuna is good by very choice. On the other side, we have Duryodhana who always chose the side of wrong. To cut the long story short let us come to the situation that the war is taking place between Pandavas and Kauravas and Arjuna is the leader of Pandavas and Duryodhana who is on the side of wrong. Another interesting aspect is that these bad people Duryodhana and others are also cousins and relatives of Arjuna. </span><br/><span>When Arjuna came to the battlefield to fight the war, he saw his cousins and relatives on the other side waiting to fight the war. When he saw his own people on the other side, he has a doubt or confusion as follows. If he fights this war, he will be killing his own people. On one side, he is here to fight the battle and on the other side if he is fighting, he has to kill his own cousins and relatives. He tells Krishna, “Why should I fight this war where I know I am going to rule the kingdom which is drenched by the blood of my own people. I don’t want this war, I don’t want to kill people let me run away into the forest”. So on one side his mind says to fight the war and on the other side, another part the mind says, ‘don’t fight the war’. Whether he should fight the war or he should go the forest and meditate, he was not able to decide and had confusion. </span><br/><span>The confusion whether to fight the war or not has happened to Arjuna but not for Duryodhana. Duryodhana was a bad person but he did not have any problem in fighting the war but Arjuna who was goodness personified, had a problem fighting the war. Bhagavad Gita is a message given to Arjuna who is a good, and not Duryodhana who is the bad person. Arjuna was already right and therefore this message of Bhagavad-Gita can not be a message asking him to do right. This message therefore must be higher than good and bad. That is the reasons why, this knowledge is a divine knowledge higher than the pairs of opposites like right and wrong. When you try to look at Arjuna, who tried to go to the forest and meditate, it appears, similar to the situation of Buddha who also wanted to go to the forest and meditate. When you closely watch there is a lot of difference between Arjuna and Buddha. Buddha was truly interested in peace and wanted to mediate to go to peace. Buddha had no sort of confusion in his mind. On the other hand, Arjuna had confusion in his mind. Arjuna’s confusion is because his interest in not in peace. His question was, ‘should I kill my own people for the sake of winning the war. It is not that he in not interested in the war but he is not interested in war with his own people. He has no hesitation to fight the war if the people in front were not his own people. Whole life he is trained to fight the war, he is educated to fight the war, and he is always the best student in the school at the time of learning and now he came here to fight the war. So in principle he has no aversion for war. All his aversion is of fighting a war against his own people. Therefore, his interest is not in peace like Buddha’s interest, but his interest really is in not killing his own people. To say ‘my’ people, ‘my’ relatives, ‘my’ kingdom etc, are all ‘my’ - attachments. It is this attachment, which brings about this confusion or despondency. Which is given in the first chapter is the Gita. And the whole message of Gita that Krishna gives is to see that this mental depression of Arjuna is removed. To remove this mental disturbance, the technology, the methodology used, is called yoga. The scope of yoga is far more than just doing some physical postures and Pranayama practices. Though, all the chapters and slokas in Bhagavad-Gita Krishna tried to convey the idea of peace of mind and mastery over mind, there are some chapters that are concentrated especially on some particular topic of yoga. How we can bring about the concept of peace of mind in the work that we do is given in the third chapter called karma yoga. Human being has wonderful tool called the intellect and all the development we see is due to the intellect. Using this intellect to go to the peace of mind is given in the fifth chapter called Jnana yoga. The sixth chapter is giving the method of discipline called the Raja yoga. Of all the chapters the smallest and the simplest is twelfth chapter, where Krishna gives the method in which we use emotions to go to peace of mind and this is called, the Bhakti Yoga. Bhakti Yoga is the most important chapter, and it is the point of discussion for today.</span><br/><br/><em>-to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Bhakti Yoga -part 1-","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-12-18T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-12-18T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-12-18T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":130,"uuid":"fc54b544-b0f4-4433-a08c-3f8227034b3f","title":"Pictures from Speaker on Campus Seminars and Hindu Sangam 2006 Report","slug":"pictures-from-speaker-on-campus-seminars-and-hindu-sangam-2006-report","markdown":"<p><span>Dear all, </span><br/><span>Below you may see a few pictures from Speaker on Campus (SoC) seminar series, that are continuing in USA.

We really do not know how many of them have really understood what yoga means or how yoga has been explained in the parampara! The word yoga is not some thing new or need to be invented fresh. It has come since the start of this civilization and culture and has been consistent with its definition through out these many years.</span><br/><span>Sage Patanjali in his treatise on yoga called yoga sutras gives us the technique how to reach the state of yoga with the help of ‘Astanga yoga’ which is very popular in the scholars’ circle. Adi Shankarachaya’s teacher’s teacher Gaudapada while writing the commentary on Mandukya Upanishad has given a method called “Asparsha yoga”, which is based on the principle investigation taken up by Mandukya Upanishad. </span><br/><span>Mandukya Upanishad has a great appeal for the scientists because of two essential features. One is the simplicity and brevity of the subject content. No unnecessary information is given. And the second feature is the similarity between scientific investigation and inner investigation. Objects of the world may be many and random but in order to understand the matter science divides various elements into categories such as solids liquids and gases each category having common properties. Similarly our experiences may be many and appear very random. Mandukya Upanishad very successfully categorized our experiences into three categories and from there derives how this can lead us into the experience of the atman. </span><br/><span>Atman is not a theory but we need to experience the state of atman. How can we have this experience? Is it some thing that has to come about or is it already there. If it is some thing which has to come then does it also not go away? If it is also having the quality of coming and going then why is it so important? Is it not like other experiences? Thus our enquiry has all these doubts.</span><br/><span>Let us therefore take it slowly step by step to see how we can find out answer to all these questions. </span><br/><span>All our experiences can be divided into three categories. First of them is the wakeful state experiences. It is the experiences in the gross world and the experiences are gross. There are nineteen (opening) mouths through which we have nourishment in this wakeful experience. There are few points we need to recognize here. First one is that nineteen senses are five perception sensory organs, five locomotion organs, five pranas, and four internal modifications of the mind namely mind, intellect, mind stuff and the ego. What ever interactions we have with these nineteen openings, they all belong to gross world. There can not be any experience which belongs to these senses and in the nature of subtle world. If I say that I am seeing with my eyes, it only means I am seeing in the gross world.</span><br/><span>All these experiences are for gross nourishment. It is our decision to see what we interact is for our nourishment. If our interaction in this world is not providing us nourishment we can not blame any one but ourselves, because it is for us to accept things which are for our nourishment. We also follow this unconsciously. When we take banana we peel the skin away and take the fruit in it. The skin is not nourishing but the fruit is nourishing. Same way when we buy a toffee we take away the paper and eat the toffee. Even a child knows that, what is nourishing need to be taken and what is not nourishing we should just simply discord. Instinctively child throws away the food if child is full because eating food after being full is not nourishing. These cases are simple, but why not we think in the same way in all the cases. The food we eat should have the effect of nourishing if not we need not go for that. We find facts of nourishment in the form of labels on various food items these days and people select food accordingly. Organic foods are nourishing and foods which are chemically processed are not nourishing. Therefore, these days, people select organically grown foods and avoid foods which are chemically grown. An important fact we need to know in this regard. Nourishment factor has one more consideration. The food belongs to hunger. Food has to be given to hunger. If you are not hungry and give food that food is like poison and will be no-nourishing. We need to look at it more carefully. Are we giving food to the hunger within us? Are we eating food because we are hungry or are we eating food because of some other reasons? Many times we may be eating not because we are hungry but because we find the food interesting or we have nothing else to do so let us eat! Such food is not nourishing. When we take food it is also necessary that we have pleasant mood. Otherwise the food will not be nourishing. It is also not just the food items but the ingredients which go into food in what combination they are taken are also important. Instead of considering all thee things lot of orthodox people pay their attention seriously on who touches and what touches the food.</span><br/><span>We can accept to some extent that we follow in food about what is nourishing very carefully. But the Upanishad says that the fact of nourishment does not belong only to the food that we take thorough the mouth but also to all other organs, because we nourish in this gross world through all our nineteen senses. What we hear through our ears has to be nourishing and what we see should be nourishing. We need to introspect ourselves about this. We read daily news paper or we read so many junk novels. Did we any time think whether what we read is nourishing or not. We see movies but have we thought if that movie is nourishing for us or not. Similarly we are engaged in gossip so often but have we thought of the nourishment we get out of it. </span><br/><span>This awareness at once makes us a different person. You will recognize that a host of things in which we are engaged, become wasteful and non- nourishing. There is no reason for us to keep blindly taking it. </span><br/><span>Another aspect is that, not only the external sensory organs, our internal organs are also for the sake of nourishing. The movement of motor organs is for the sake of nourishing. This concept is interesting. The animals and human beings are provided with the limbs which we need to utilize regularly on daily basis. If we fail to use our organs after few days or months we loose the ability if using the limbs. If we immobilize the limbs for few days the body part looses its functional ability. When we have a fracture or a dislocation we immobilize the limb for six weeks so that the bone rejoins. But due to immobilizing the part that hand or leg will not have any strength to perform simple duties. It takes some days of training before we can use that part of the body. Therefore it is necessary to continue to do the activities or exercise so that body will not become useless. In the ancient times people used to go to walk miles together in daily activities, sit down and stand up several hundred times in every day life and lift weights countless number of times every day. As we have become more and more sophisticated and technology developed we have appliances and gadgets to take care of all these activities and we don’t do with our body. We don’t walk any more because we need car even to go small distances. We don’t lift weights, which is taken care of by mechanical devises. Sitting down is nearly forgotten as we have couches and sofas which have also become a status symbol. Even a simple thing like hand writing is also forgotten by many because the computers have come. Since we don’t use these limbs and small joints we suffer from all sorts of ailments at body level. That is why Upanishad says that we need to do the activities with the motor organs so that we are nourishing. We need to do physical works such as walking, sitting and standing, lifting weights, all such activities for the sake of nourishing.</span><br/><span>Not only the five pranas but the four internal modifications of mind stuff, namely mind, intellect, memory and ego are also for nourishing. What we think and what we memorize should also be for the sake of nourishing. We normally keep in mind only negative thoughts of any person and bad experience encountered and tend to forget good things. Even though it may be a single thing happened, we keep that in mind much more than several good things about him or her. Keep those things which are nourishing in your mind. We have to be careful to exercise ‘ego’ which is nourishing for us and if it is not nourishing we should have the freedom to discard it. People pursue their ego in all cases where it is non-nourishing. This is non spiritual according to the Upanishad.</span><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><span>Several people are practicing some thing in the name of yoga all over the world.

Adi Shankarachaya’s teacher’s teacher Gaudapada while writing the commentary on Mandukya Upanishad has given a method called “Asparsha yoga”, which is based on the principle investigation taken up by Mandukya Upanishad. </span><br/><span>Mandukya Upanishad has a great appeal for the scientists because of two essential features. One is the simplicity and brevity of the subject content. No unnecessary information is given. And the second feature is the similarity between scientific investigation and inner investigation. Objects of the world may be many and random but in order to understand the matter science divides various elements into categories such as solids liquids and gases each category having common properties. Similarly our experiences may be many and appear very random. Mandukya Upanishad very successfully categorized our experiences into three categories and from there derives how this can lead us into the experience of the atman. </span><br/><span>Atman is not a theory but we need to experience the state of atman. How can we have this experience? Is it some thing that has to come about or is it already there. If it is some thing which has to come then does it also not go away? If it is also having the quality of coming and going then why is it so important? Is it not like other experiences? Thus our enquiry has all these doubts.</span><br/><span>Let us therefore take it slowly step by step to see how we can find out answer to all these questions. </span><br/><span>All our experiences can be divided into three categories. First of them is the wakeful state experiences. It is the experiences in the gross world and the experiences are gross. There are nineteen (opening) mouths through which we have nourishment in this wakeful experience. There are few points we need to recognize here. First one is that nineteen senses are five perception sensory organs, five locomotion organs, five pranas, and four internal modifications of the mind namely mind, intellect, mind stuff and the ego. What ever interactions we have with these nineteen openings, they all belong to gross world. There can not be any experience which belongs to these senses and in the nature of subtle world. If I say that I am seeing with my eyes, it only means I am seeing in the gross world.</span><br/><span>All these experiences are for gross nourishment. It is our decision to see what we interact is for our nourishment. If our interaction in this world is not providing us nourishment we can not blame any one but ourselves, because it is for us to accept things which are for our nourishment. We also follow this unconsciously. When we take banana we peel the skin away and take the fruit in it. The skin is not nourishing but the fruit is nourishing. Same way when we buy a toffee we take away the paper and eat the toffee. Even a child knows that, what is nourishing need to be taken and what is not nourishing we should just simply discord. Instinctively child throws away the food if child is full because eating food after being full is not nourishing. These cases are simple, but why not we think in the same way in all the cases. The food we eat should have the effect of nourishing if not we need not go for that. We find facts of nourishment in the form of labels on various food items these days and people select food accordingly. Organic foods are nourishing and foods which are chemically processed are not nourishing. Therefore, these days, people select organically grown foods and avoid foods which are chemically grown. An important fact we need to know in this regard. Nourishment factor has one more consideration. The food belongs to hunger. Food has to be given to hunger. If you are not hungry and give food that food is like poison and will be no-nourishing. We need to look at it more carefully. Are we giving food to the hunger within us? Are we eating food because we are hungry or are we eating food because of some other reasons? Many times we may be eating not because we are hungry but because we find the food interesting or we have nothing else to do so let us eat! Such food is not nourishing. When we take food it is also necessary that we have pleasant mood. Otherwise the food will not be nourishing. It is also not just the food items but the ingredients which go into food in what combination they are taken are also important. Instead of considering all thee things lot of orthodox people pay their attention seriously on who touches and what touches the food.</span><br/><span>We can accept to some extent that we follow in food about what is nourishing very carefully. But the Upanishad says that the fact of nourishment does not belong only to the food that we take thorough the mouth but also to all other organs, because we nourish in this gross world through all our nineteen senses. What we hear through our ears has to be nourishing and what we see should be nourishing. We need to introspect ourselves about this. We read daily news paper or we read so many junk novels. Did we any time think whether what we read is nourishing or not. We see movies but have we thought if that movie is nourishing for us or not. Similarly we are engaged in gossip so often but have we thought of the nourishment we get out of it. </span><br/><span>This awareness at once makes us a different person. You will recognize that a host of things in which we are engaged, become wasteful and non- nourishing. There is no reason for us to keep blindly taking it. </span><br/><span>Another aspect is that, not only the external sensory organs, our internal organs are also for the sake of nourishing. The movement of motor organs is for the sake of nourishing. This concept is interesting. The animals and human beings are provided with the limbs which we need to utilize regularly on daily basis. If we fail to use our organs after few days or months we loose the ability if using the limbs. If we immobilize the limbs for few days the body part looses its functional ability. When we have a fracture or a dislocation we immobilize the limb for six weeks so that the bone rejoins. But due to immobilizing the part that hand or leg will not have any strength to perform simple duties. It takes some days of training before we can use that part of the body. Therefore it is necessary to continue to do the activities or exercise so that body will not become useless. In the ancient times people used to go to walk miles together in daily activities, sit down and stand up several hundred times in every day life and lift weights countless number of times every day. As we have become more and more sophisticated and technology developed we have appliances and gadgets to take care of all these activities and we don’t do with our body. We don’t walk any more because we need car even to go small distances. We don’t lift weights, which is taken care of by mechanical devises. Sitting down is nearly forgotten as we have couches and sofas which have also become a status symbol. Even a simple thing like hand writing is also forgotten by many because the computers have come. Since we don’t use these limbs and small joints we suffer from all sorts of ailments at body level. That is why Upanishad says that we need to do the activities with the motor organs so that we are nourishing. We need to do physical works such as walking, sitting and standing, lifting weights, all such activities for the sake of nourishing.</span><br/><span>Not only the five pranas but the four internal modifications of mind stuff, namely mind, intellect, memory and ego are also for nourishing. What we think and what we memorize should also be for the sake of nourishing. We normally keep in mind only negative thoughts of any person and bad experience encountered and tend to forget good things. Even though it may be a single thing happened, we keep that in mind much more than several good things about him or her. Keep those things which are nourishing in your mind. We have to be careful to exercise ‘ego’ which is nourishing for us and if it is not nourishing we should have the freedom to discard it. People pursue their ego in all cases where it is non-nourishing. This is non spiritual according to the Upanishad.</span><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Asparsha Yoga - Part 1","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-11-23T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-11-23T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-11-23T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":40,"uuid":"0e56853c-e147-47a5-943b-e84c80f231a9","title":"Pooja vs Prayer and Worship","slug":"pooja-vs-prayer-and-worship","markdown":"<p><span>A friend of mine Dr Anirudh having read my article on the meditation and Dhyana expressed that I should write about pooja or worship also giving the picture according to Indian philosophy.</span><br/><br/><span>Pooja is one of those words, which is very widely used in the Indian culture. This is so because in Indian culture, every house is having temple in the house and they offer daily pooja. This house of pooja will normally have the idols of or pictures of several gods of their own choice and many houses also keep the photographs of the saints sadhus or swamiji’s who either lived in the recent past or who are also living even now. Therefore, pooja is a very common word in the household in India. I do not think pooja to be translated as ‘prayer’. It is very different as pooja does not emerge from praying per say. in English we may say it as worship but we need to understand pooja clearly. I do not know the full meaning and philosophy behind the English word called ‘WORSHIP’ but let me here give some of the details of pooja its philosophy, which may help them not only to appreciate the depth of the ideas about pooja but also to follow it with this understanding in the day-to-day life.</span><br/><br/><span>The pooja place in a house is very intimately and emotionally associated with the owner of the house, I observed several times that the owner started building the house and the engineer would have put the marks on the ground about foundation for various walls. The moment the marking for the pooja room is there on the ground, the owner does not step there with his foot wear on because going into pooja room with footwear is disrespect to god! One could see such a thing in the earlier days where the owner would have built house himself and not like the culture of apartment houses these days.</span><br/><br/><span>According to Sage Narada, pooja, or what we translate as worship, has two components.</span><br/><br/><span>Poojadishu Anuraga iti prasharyah II </span><br/><br/><span>[The anuraga in pooja and other things is Bhakti according to Parashara’s son Vyasa.]</span><br/><br/><span>The component called Anuraga is the element of Bhakti in the case of doing Pooja. This brings about a question what is the other component, which is there in our culture along with the Anuraga? That component is the Physical details of the practice of worship.</span><br/><br/><span>He did not specifically make mention of it because this is some thing which one can see very clearly out side. The problem is that many people take this alone as the Bhakti. Let us try to understand it in detail.</span><br/><br/><span>Like many other things in the nature, pooja also has two components. One is the outer component and the other is the inner component, like the body and the soul. What we normally see is the outer component, the visible component and the other the invisible component or the hidden component. The outer part the body is having meaning and purpose only when there is the inner component. The freedom the growth, and the joy and satisfaction, which we see in the body, they all belong to the soul and not to the body. Body alone does not have any of these things.</span><br/><br/><span>Similarly, the practice of pooja also has two components. The practice details, the gods and their details, method and the ingredients involved, are the outer structure and what Narada calls as anuraga, is the inner component. This anuraga is again very difficult to translate in English. Roughly this can be understood as the feeling intimacy with, the feeling the presence of god in your heart and not in head. Anuraga is richer and nobler than attachment. You are doing out of pure joy in giving or doing for others! Feeling is some thing you can see from out side. It is one’s own experience happening inside. It is intimacy with the god or with the other so that the other will not be there as other any longer.</span><br/><br/><span>Pooja is the real one when the feeling of intimacy leads us into pooja or the worship. At that time in just doing pooja, you are satisfied and you are not looking for any further happenings. If there is any other demand or other expectations and the satisfaction depends upon any further happenings such as some grace or some benefit f winning a lottery or exams etc then the pooja becomes secondary. Therefore, anuraga is the seed for the pooja and your feeling is the seed, as the plant is the expression of the seed planted. Anuraga comes from deep respect, love, wonder, closeness and intimacy all blended into one thing!</span><br/><br/><span>The technique of pooja involves saying some mantras in Sanskrit and in between offering various things. If you look at these mantras they give a very simple meaning like this.</span><br/><br/><span>To start with, you offer your prayers and welcome the god. Offer him water so that he can wash his feet and his hands before entering so that he is purified of all the dust from out side. The corresponding mantras are ‘Padau prakshalayami and Hastau prakshaayami’. Stapayami poojayami, make his to sit down Asanam sweekrutya requesting god to accept the seat. The moment god comes light comes in to the house.. Symbolically the moment he comes in the lights are lighted and you offer him fragrance by lighting the dhoop sticks. The mantra for that is dhoopa deepam agrapayami. Depending up on the god we are worshipping we select the items for pooja. When we do the pooja of lord Ganesha because he is with elephant head he loves to eat the grass and fresh leaves his appetite is vast so. We prepare several varieties of sweets and offer him grass and variety of leaves and sugar cane etc. While offering with each mantra, which is the praise of god, we offer one thing. Since he is a child he likes to be with children so that day all the children go round several houses to see Ganesha and in his presence which ever may be the house children do some simple yoga exercise, scientists found in USA recently that this exercise is good for improving memory and attention. When we offer food to the god especially whenever any item is felt to be having spicy taste then naturally, he requires water in between to feel cool inside. There is a mantra for that saying, madhyemadhye paneeyam samarpayami. In between water is offered. In the evening, we offer music and dance programs and in the night, there are special rituals suggesting god Ganesha is being put to bed and there are bed tie stories. There are lullabies for all gods in Indian philosophy and culture. In the morning, there are wakeup songs for the lord. These activities are so sweet that they do not pace god far above beyond clouds. Thus, pooja is a practice for a very intimate specialized guest for you and the family. All these steps create the necessary psychological posture and inner preparedness. There are also substitutes in case you miss some thing you do not have to feel guilty about it. Rice with yellow colour and some times even some camphor or other essence is added, can substitute any of the missing items. Like the mantra says offer nice dress to god and if not available offer handful of this rice known as akshata in place of the cloth or dress. Vasteram samarpayami. Offer cloths and if not available offer akshata. tadabhave ashatam samarpayami. The best available material such as curd, coconut water, honey, thick milk, and dry fruits etc are all material for offering because god likes them! Having used the substitute items at the end out of humility there are also mantras praying to the god, ‘oh, lord, please for give me if I had done any thing wrong knowingly or unknowingly since it is not out of intention of doing things wrong way but my own other limitations.</span><br/><br/><span>Since the pooja is the expression of the deep love and oneness with god, you are experiencing the day of pooja you are not to get angry or irritated towards anybody and to keep cheerful mood and freely exchange cheers with all. Thus, these pooja will make our mind positive and helps arise above the level of complaints. This has to be done with pure inner experience of divinity. Now the question comes how to develop this feeling of presence of divinity!</span><br/><br/><span>Our life gives us many experiences or opportunities to develop this deep respect and love. On many occasions things will happen to you unexpectedly which brings about great happiness to you! If only you think deeply you will realize that things would not have happened if you planned and worked for it. It is not by your effort that things happened that way. Many times even in spite of you things would have happened in a favourable way to you and this can only be possible due to some grace from some unknown quarters. If you think like that, you will be filled with unusual joy and at the same time filled with such great reverence that you feel the help you received is from god beyond! We can let this situation slip away by saying egoistically that we have achieved it and it is purely our effort!</span><br/><br/><span>Only when one gives up this claim on the doer-ship and deeply feels touched by god then pooja the feeling of prardhana comes up whose expression is pooja! This feeling inside is the mother of all the rituals and all the forms of god and all the mantras and chantings which are the manifest form outside.</span><br/><br/><span>Not only in Indian philosophy but also in all the spiritual paths have emerged with the practices that are, expressions of great saints who gave the expression to their inner experience. Those who must have been around such great personalities would have seen their masters and would have been seen the shades of god on the faces of their masters and thus they adapted the rituals very diligently! However, later persons would have only followed the practices and further they become mechanical rituals and the soul the anuraga is not adapted.</span><br/><br/><span>If we observe the details of pooja one can notice that pooja consists of treating god as human being and welcoming him in the best possible way and offering him the water to wash his or her feel and fanning him after making him sit comfortably before you start any thing further. In case of Lord Ganesh since he is a child we need to get the permission from his mother so that we can take him to our house and for that you worship her before and please her so that she will not deny your request when you ask her permission to take lord Ganesh with you. In addition, all the days the god is with you provide time-to-time food entertainment and all that so that he will stay with you very happily and finally send him back to his abode with all care and love. Thus in all the pooja methods god is personified. For some people it may look silly but nature is such that all our emotions we need personification to find expression. Simple example is the dreams! Dream are he expression of our motions like fear anxiety or anger deep in our minds. They find their vent in our dreams where we see some persons or some animals and we have expression of our emotions. When we wake up we realise what we have seen is not real but in the process we find expression for our emotions. Bhakti is conscious tool to manifest our good emotions of love, reverence etc. However, unless until we bring god to the human level and treat god, like another human being very intimately related to you, we will not give expression to these emotions. Then the whole practice becomes mechanical and there is no devotion behind our doing pooja.</span><br/><br/><span>Once I was giving a series of lectures on Upanishads in a temple in Los Angeles. The organisers wanted to introduce me to the pujari who is employed to do pooja in the temple. When my fried took me to him he was talking to some one holding the phone in his right hand to his ear discussing about the share market and with the other hand he was offering the flowers to the god image and with the same hand he took the holy water ‘teerthem’ and offered to me! My friend felt that he has not heard him earlier introducing me so he attempted to tell him that I am the speaker on Upanishads in the temple, for which he replied ‘yes I know sir’, and continued to talk on the phone. Where is the spirit of pooja in this? pooja is not just a worship where you follow some rituals or say some mantras - holy chants, ringing some bells and finally feel relieved at the end of all that exercise relieved in the sense that now you can establish your claim for his grace and put in front of him your demands list. It is a method, which can flow the fullest expression to your heartfelt emotions and you are fully absorbed in his consciousness so that you become one with the divinity. The earlier sages who have given expression to their experience in the form of pooja methodology will feel satisfied.</span><br/><br/><span>That is the reason Nerada expresses in the subsequent sutra that you become one with god, ‘tanmayah’ out of love. When you go to god out of fear or favour god is not important, you are important. God is some one who is attending to your demands. If he has to keep his position then he has to attend other wise in your eyes he looses his position as god! When you go to god out of love, which is enriched in the form of devotion and deep respect and intimacy, then god is important and you are unimportant! Your worth is only in dissolving in god!</span><br/><br/><span>In the beginning, you become self-conscious about others observing you when you are doing pooja. Therefore, all cultures provided methods, which people can follow in the group so that you can do the rituals. Soon it is important that you do the pooja in aloneness and not in the presence of others where you can freely express your feeling from your heart, you can cry you can dance or you can use any other form of expressing your heart. That is the reason, sage Narada said in another sutra ‘Bhaktinah Ekantino Mukhyah’. Bhakti practitioner needs to practice in aloneness with god so that he can find his true expression. Therefore, people go to the temples and we have group ritual practices in the society but at the same time, every house we have temples where people do their pooja alone! Many times people do not find that kind of devotion in the, so-called big temples, what they get in their simple home temple. True pooja is to surrender to god and no to claim the achievements and it should make you humble. The people how does pooja and becomes arrogant and looks down upon others who do not do pooja are not sincere in their pooja.</span><br/><br/><span>A little child is playing with her doll for hours and mother was happy that the child has not done mischief. The child is engaged in offering child in doll food and tea and all such things. The child also changes the diaper of the doll child raises the tone like mother does and gives instructions to the child.</span><br/><br/><span>Mother has seen the child is playing for hours. I the evening the mother now instructs the child @ now you played enough with the doll now keep it a side and wash your hands and legs and come for dinner. Child replies to the mother “please, mom, don’t shout I am coming in few minutes child will be sleeping any moment and you don’t raise your voice that will disturb the sleep of the child”. Mother in reply says, “There is nothing like child and after all it is a doll. Don’t worry”. Pained in her heart the child says to the child doll motherly words, “you please you don’t take it to your heart, mom shouts and that is her nature, you go to sleep now. I will come back soon and be by your side”. Child feels the presence of consciousness in the doll, which mother does not see. Same way the person who does pooja must see the consciousness being present and not the stone idol; then only pooja is real pooja or worship is real worship and not otherwise!</span></p>","html":"<p><span>A friend of mine Dr Anirudh having read my article on the meditation and Dhyana expressed that I should write about pooja or worship also giving the picture according to Indian philosophy.</span><br/><br/><span>Pooja is one of those words, which is very widely used in the Indian culture.

In addition, all the days the god is with you provide time-to-time food entertainment and all that so that he will stay with you very happily and finally send him back to his abode with all care and love. Thus in all the pooja methods god is personified. For some people it may look silly but nature is such that all our emotions we need personification to find expression. Simple example is the dreams! Dream are he expression of our motions like fear anxiety or anger deep in our minds. They find their vent in our dreams where we see some persons or some animals and we have expression of our emotions. When we wake up we realise what we have seen is not real but in the process we find expression for our emotions. Bhakti is conscious tool to manifest our good emotions of love, reverence etc. However, unless until we bring god to the human level and treat god, like another human being very intimately related to you, we will not give expression to these emotions. Then the whole practice becomes mechanical and there is no devotion behind our doing pooja.</span><br/><br/><span>Once I was giving a series of lectures on Upanishads in a temple in Los Angeles. The organisers wanted to introduce me to the pujari who is employed to do pooja in the temple. When my fried took me to him he was talking to some one holding the phone in his right hand to his ear discussing about the share market and with the other hand he was offering the flowers to the god image and with the same hand he took the holy water ‘teerthem’ and offered to me! My friend felt that he has not heard him earlier introducing me so he attempted to tell him that I am the speaker on Upanishads in the temple, for which he replied ‘yes I know sir’, and continued to talk on the phone. Where is the spirit of pooja in this? pooja is not just a worship where you follow some rituals or say some mantras - holy chants, ringing some bells and finally feel relieved at the end of all that exercise relieved in the sense that now you can establish your claim for his grace and put in front of him your demands list. It is a method, which can flow the fullest expression to your heartfelt emotions and you are fully absorbed in his consciousness so that you become one with the divinity. The earlier sages who have given expression to their experience in the form of pooja methodology will feel satisfied.</span><br/><br/><span>That is the reason Nerada expresses in the subsequent sutra that you become one with god, ‘tanmayah’ out of love. When you go to god out of fear or favour god is not important, you are important. God is some one who is attending to your demands. If he has to keep his position then he has to attend other wise in your eyes he looses his position as god! When you go to god out of love, which is enriched in the form of devotion and deep respect and intimacy, then god is important and you are unimportant! Your worth is only in dissolving in god!</span><br/><br/><span>In the beginning, you become self-conscious about others observing you when you are doing pooja. Therefore, all cultures provided methods, which people can follow in the group so that you can do the rituals. Soon it is important that you do the pooja in aloneness and not in the presence of others where you can freely express your feeling from your heart, you can cry you can dance or you can use any other form of expressing your heart. That is the reason, sage Narada said in another sutra ‘Bhaktinah Ekantino Mukhyah’. Bhakti practitioner needs to practice in aloneness with god so that he can find his true expression. Therefore, people go to the temples and we have group ritual practices in the society but at the same time, every house we have temples where people do their pooja alone! Many times people do not find that kind of devotion in the, so-called big temples, what they get in their simple home temple. True pooja is to surrender to god and no to claim the achievements and it should make you humble. The people how does pooja and becomes arrogant and looks down upon others who do not do pooja are not sincere in their pooja.</span><br/><br/><span>A little child is playing with her doll for hours and mother was happy that the child has not done mischief. The child is engaged in offering child in doll food and tea and all such things. The child also changes the diaper of the doll child raises the tone like mother does and gives instructions to the child.</span><br/><br/><span>Mother has seen the child is playing for hours. I the evening the mother now instructs the child @ now you played enough with the doll now keep it a side and wash your hands and legs and come for dinner. Child replies to the mother “please, mom, don’t shout I am coming in few minutes child will be sleeping any moment and you don’t raise your voice that will disturb the sleep of the child”. Mother in reply says, “There is nothing like child and after all it is a doll. Don’t worry”. Pained in her heart the child says to the child doll motherly words, “you please you don’t take it to your heart, mom shouts and that is her nature, you go to sleep now. I will come back soon and be by your side”. Child feels the presence of consciousness in the doll, which mother does not see. Same way the person who does pooja must see the consciousness being present and not the stone idol; then only pooja is real pooja or worship is real worship and not otherwise!</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Pooja vs Prayer and

factors influence the accuracy of this science?</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When the social system was well organized based on triguna concept that understands and merges the micro and macrocosm, it was not difficult for some one to predict what could be the physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral characteristics of a child that is born in that particular system of organization. It is not only the position of the stars (time and space) that influence our life. The life events are highly influenced by our basic nature. We have seen how much it depends on the strong impressions from the previous life (samskaras), the type of personality (‘guna’), the social structure and a strong will or self effort. We should not forget or ignore the basic character of the society in those days. If astrology has to predict with accuracy about how your business would flourish in the next few years, it depends on all these four factors i.e. your basic guna , the social structure, self effort and the time space interaction.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Why astrology is not accepted as a science today?</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Human values such as sharing and caring, happiness and contentment were valued and respected in the spiritually oriented, moral society in ancient India where the science of astrology developed. An astrologer was expected to live a very strict life of austerity, selflessness and contentment so that he could tune to the higher laws of nature. An astrologer is expected to be like a saint not having any attachment to material aspects and to have absolute self control. A small little attraction can wrongly influence the predictions totally. This was another important parameter that ensured the accuracy of this science. Today’s society is simply revolving around money, materialism and selfishness. Every thing else including morality has taken the lowest berth in every walk of life including the so called future tellers. This has naturally changed the definitions of life events such as success, achievement, virtues and values of life.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I feel that with the changing of times and the social structure these sciences of predictions such as astrology or numerology, palmistry, etc should have been revised. But unfortunately we have not updated these sciences and hence they seem to have lost their reliability. Today we have landed in a state wherein these predictions appear to be not at all reliable that has made us discard this out of the arena of verifiable sciences.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In addition as I explained earlier, things were very rational and logical and based on evidences to start with but later on, as there were no experts who could explain these things rationally, it became a blind faith and dogma. Once it became a blind faith several meaningless things have crept into our day to day living that has created more fear than knowledge. The so called petty astrologers with very limited knowledge have taken advantage of the innocence of the people. I remember while I was working as engineer one of my senior colleagues was so much stuck to his blind faith and overwhelmed with the fear of the unknown that he would never sign the papers in rahukala (not so suitable time of day according to the position of the stars) however important it was. So we had to attach an almanac and check the time of presenting the papers to him to get his signature. This was not based on knowledge but he was threatened by the so called pundits that if you do not follow this meticulously it will cause calamities in the family and loss in business etc.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">How do we use this science today?</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">First of all we need to understand that these predictions are only indicative of the possibility of some unexpected events of life and be prepared to face the difficulties if any with a proper mind set. It is clear that the accuracy of these mathematical calculations is good for phenomena that have already happened in the past. For predictions about the future this science provides the probability of an event. We can use it for planning our life just like you would plan your day’s schedule based on weather predictions. Let us consider this knowledge as precautions and not get lost in the fear of the unknown.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Some people are not only eager to know what is going to happen in the future but they also depend on it as if it is every thing and become lazy and complacent. For example, if an astrologer tells me that I will become a prime minister then the story does not end there. I need to continue to work my sweat out to fight the elections and do all the work needed to keep the image in the society. But this prediction makes me confident that I stand a good chance through my stars that I can pass the test and get there.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Is it important to know what is going to happen in future? How to use these predictions about the unfavorable or difficult events of our life without fear? There is a nice incident from Ramayana which is worth recollecting in this context.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">After pregnant Seeta’s departure to forest there was grave silence all over Ayodhya and every one was feeling the big void. In that grave silence one day Lakshmana was walking in the garden and saw Sumantha, the minister sitting alone under the banyan tree lost n his thoughts. Lakshmana greets but there was no response from Sumantha who was lost in his own world. Suddenly Lakshmana heard Sumantha talking to himself, “oh lord, wonderful is your leela, (play). How strong is vidhileela (play of destiny)! We know what is going to happen yet we can’t avoid even the most distressful events of life and just have to accept and go through them! ”. Lakshmana shakes Samantha out of his state of deeply lost in mood and asks “what are you saying and about whom are you talking?” Samantha was surprised to see Lakshmana and replied, “I am talking about your great father”. “What is it”? Lakshmana asks. Sumantha says, “Your father knew that the separation from his son would kill him but he could not stop Rama from going to the forest.”! Surprised Lakshmana asks “how did he know and how do you know about it?” Sumantha in reply narrated the event of what he had seen when he was young and used to be the charioteer for Dasaratha. King Dasharatha, when he was young used to enjoy the sport of shooting an arrow by just listening to the sound of an animal in the forest (shabdabhedi vidya).On one such occasions he mistook the sound of water being filled into a pot in the river to the sound of a deer drinking water in the river and the most unfortunate event happened. The only son of a blind sage who had gone to fetch water to quench the thirst of his blind parents became the victim. On request by the dying child the shattered king takes water to the thirsty parents of the boy. The moment the parents knew that the king whose duty is to protect people killed their innocent son out of carelessness they cursed King Dasharatha that he will also die of separation from his beloved son and gave up their lives at once . Lakshmana became emotional and said, ‘why did you not tell me this? If I had known I would have stopped Rama from going to the forest’. Sumantha smiled and said “Your father who was such a great king and Rama such a wonderful person who is so wise could not do anything but to accept the ways of destiny .do you think you can have stopped them?” “What! Rama also knew about it, how?” Lakshmana asked in surprise. Sumantha replied, “Rama is so great that there is nothing that he does not know. He can see the past and the future with clarity”. “Lakshmana asks, “then did he also know that mother Seetha would be sent to forest”. Sumantha replied, “Yes”. Lakshmana asks “then why did he not stop that?” Sumantha “My dear Lakshmana, I just do not know. All that I know is that they are so great and I am so small a person that I only feel blessed that I am born in the times that such great persons are around!” and added “if you have any more questions go and ask your brother . I am too small a person to answer your doubts”.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Lakshmana runs to his brother who was sitting peacefully and narrated all that he heard from Sumantha and asks, “Rama, you knew that mother Seetha has to go to forest and you did not stop her, why?” Rama replied, “Lakshmana, it is not important to know what is going to happen and try to stop it. I know that we cannot stop destiny which is so strong. What is important is to be able accept and maintain equanimity, peace and tranquility, when such major events of life happen. This is the goal of life .This is spiritual growth. On the other hand generally what happens is that if we come to know what is going to happen and if we also know that you cannot do any thing we tend to suffer helplessly”.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore let us understand the message of Rama to Lakshmana. ‘Instead of trying to waste our time by trying to find out what is there in future let us do what is good now and keep our poise in tact so that what ever the future brings us we will be able to face it calmly’. Let us not put our efforts to hear predictions and be carried away by the excitement of good events and anxiety and nervousness about the possible failures .We know that life has ups and downs. Therefore let us have spiritual growth of peace and calmness in the first place in our lives and not waste our precious time on this earth in searching for future tellers to find out what is going to happen.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Summary</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Let us get back to where we started. Are the examples of child prodigies aberrations of nature? Are these phenomena accidents of nature? Is there something predictable about it? Is there a science that understands these phenomena? How relevant are these sciences today?</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I hope you can now see how this science of predictions has a strong basis of unity of existence managed by a universal intelligence. Any event that appears to be an unusual phenomenon is not an accident or aberration of nature. It follows a higher law. This higher law works very efficiently when everything that is created in nature functions in tune with these laws. The accuracy and outcome of these predictions by the science of astrology depends on the following five factors (i) the basic instincts that we carry from our previous birth (ii) the time space interaction at the time of our birth (iii)the personality ( satva, rajas or tamas guna that predominates) which depends on the family in which we are born (iv) the social structure that provides the congenial environment and (v)the most important factor , the hard work that we need to put in to make these come true . We call these unseen factors as the play of destiny or bad luck or good luck. But what we have understood is that this destiny is predictable and has a wonderful mathematical science called astrology that worked effectively in Ancient India.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">We as a human race, ignorant of these higher laws, have no right to tamper this. Let us grow out of the limited vision of creation. Let us adore this wonderful great universal principle that binds us together in this web of life. Let us appreciate and be happy with everything that we possess. This is divinity. Let us not go on tampering with nature in search of happiness. This is true spirituality.</span></span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Love,</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">What factors influence the accuracy of this science?</span></span></span></strong></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When the social system was well organized based on triguna concept that understands and merges the micro and macrocosm, it was not difficult for some one to predict what could be the physical, emotional, cognitive and behavioral characteristics of a child that is born in that particular system of organization.

It is clear that the accuracy of these mathematical calculations is good for phenomena that have already happened in the past. For predictions about the future this science provides the probability of an event. We can use it for planning our life just like you would plan your day’s schedule based on weather predictions. Let us consider this knowledge as precautions and not get lost in the fear of the unknown.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Some people are not only eager to know what is going to happen in the future but they also depend on it as if it is every thing and become lazy and complacent. For example, if an astrologer tells me that I will become a prime minister then the story does not end there. I need to continue to work my sweat out to fight the elections and do all the work needed to keep the image in the society. But this prediction makes me confident that I stand a good chance through my stars that I can pass the test and get there.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Is it important to know what is going to happen in future? How to use these predictions about the unfavorable or difficult events of our life without fear? There is a nice incident from Ramayana which is worth recollecting in this context.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">After pregnant Seeta’s departure to forest there was grave silence all over Ayodhya and every one was feeling the big void. In that grave silence one day Lakshmana was walking in the garden and saw Sumantha, the minister sitting alone under the banyan tree lost n his thoughts. Lakshmana greets but there was no response from Sumantha who was lost in his own world. Suddenly Lakshmana heard Sumantha talking to himself, “oh lord, wonderful is your leela, (play). How strong is vidhileela (play of destiny)! We know what is going to happen yet we can’t avoid even the most distressful events of life and just have to accept and go through them! ”. Lakshmana shakes Samantha out of his state of deeply lost in mood and asks “what are you saying and about whom are you talking?” Samantha was surprised to see Lakshmana and replied, “I am talking about your great father”. “What is it”? Lakshmana asks. Sumantha says, “Your father knew that the separation from his son would kill him but he could not stop Rama from going to the forest.”! Surprised Lakshmana asks “how did he know and how do you know about it?” Sumantha in reply narrated the event of what he had seen when he was young and used to be the charioteer for Dasaratha. King Dasharatha, when he was young used to enjoy the sport of shooting an arrow by just listening to the sound of an animal in the forest (shabdabhedi vidya).On one such occasions he mistook the sound of water being filled into a pot in the river to the sound of a deer drinking water in the river and the most unfortunate event happened. The only son of a blind sage who had gone to fetch water to quench the thirst of his blind parents became the victim. On request by the dying child the shattered king takes water to the thirsty parents of the boy. The moment the parents knew that the king whose duty is to protect people killed their innocent son out of carelessness they cursed King Dasharatha that he will also die of separation from his beloved son and gave up their lives at once . Lakshmana became emotional and said, ‘why did you not tell me this? If I had known I would have stopped Rama from going to the forest’. Sumantha smiled and said “Your father who was such a great king and Rama such a wonderful person who is so wise could not do anything but to accept the ways of destiny .do you think you can have stopped them?” “What! Rama also knew about it, how?” Lakshmana asked in surprise. Sumantha replied, “Rama is so great that there is nothing that he does not know. He can see the past and the future with clarity”. “Lakshmana asks, “then did he also know that mother Seetha would be sent to forest”. Sumantha replied, “Yes”. Lakshmana asks “then why did he not stop that?” Sumantha “My dear Lakshmana, I just do not know. All that I know is that they are so great and I am so small a person that I only feel blessed that I am born in the times that such great persons are around!” and added “if you have any more questions go and ask your brother . I am too small a person to answer your doubts”.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Lakshmana runs to his brother who was sitting peacefully and narrated all that he heard from Sumantha and asks, “Rama, you knew that mother Seetha has to go to forest and you did not stop her, why?” Rama replied, “Lakshmana, it is not important to know what is going to happen and try to stop it. I know that we cannot stop destiny which is so strong. What is important is to be able accept and maintain equanimity, peace and tranquility, when such major events of life happen. This is the goal of life .This is spiritual growth. On the other hand generally what happens is that if we come to know what is going to happen and if we also know that you cannot do any thing we tend to suffer helplessly”.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore let us understand the message of Rama to Lakshmana. ‘Instead of trying to waste our time by trying to find out what is there in future let us do what is good now and keep our poise in tact so that what ever the future brings us we will be able to face it calmly’. Let us not put our efforts to hear predictions and be carried away by the excitement of good events and anxiety and nervousness about the possible failures .We know that life has ups and downs. Therefore let us have spiritual growth of peace and calmness in the first place in our lives and not waste our precious time on this earth in searching for future tellers to find out what is going to happen.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Summary</span></span></span></strong></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Let us get back to where we started. Are the examples of child prodigies aberrations of nature? Are these phenomena accidents of nature? Is there something predictable about it? Is there a science that understands these phenomena? How relevant are these sciences today?</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I hope you can now see how this science of predictions has a strong basis of unity of existence managed by a universal intelligence. Any event that appears to be an unusual phenomenon is not an accident or aberration of nature. It follows a higher law. This higher law works very efficiently when everything that is created in nature functions in tune with these laws. The accuracy and outcome of these predictions by the science of astrology depends on the following five factors (i) the basic instincts that we carry from our previous birth (ii) the time space interaction at the time of our birth (iii)the personality ( satva, rajas or tamas guna that predominates) which depends on the family in which we are born (iv) the social structure that provides the congenial environment and (v)the most important factor , the hard work that we need to put in to make these come true . We call these unseen factors as the play of destiny or bad luck or good luck. But what we have understood is that this destiny is predictable and has a wonderful mathematical science called astrology that worked effectively in Ancient India.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">We as a human race, ignorant of these higher laws, have no right to tamper this. Let us grow out of the limited vision of creation. Let us adore this wonderful great universal principle that binds us together in this web of life. Let us appreciate and be happy with everything that we possess. This is divinity. Let us not go on tampering with nature in search of happiness. This is true spirituality.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Love,</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Predictions As a Science -5-","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-10-28T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-10-28T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-10-28T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":49,"uuid":"a13aac6b-eddd-4d7d-8777-55374f590c27","title":"DEEPAVALI SHADDHANJALI offering","slug":"deepavali-shaddhanjali-offering","markdown":"<p><img align=\"top\" height=\"318.7\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/SuAh_SDXKQI/AAAAAAAAAxE/VXMHgvc-TCY/s1600/Aunty+Deepavali+Wish1.jpg\" width=\"425\"/></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I was initially thinking of writing about the Goddess Lakshmi, who is the Goddess for Deepavali or popularly known as Divali. However, the situation in Prashanti has taken a sudden turn with Aunty Lakshmi becoming serious and we had to rush for oxygen and some painkillers etc. Almost a year ago, similar situation was there and that time she has come out of such situation showing us her great will power. All of us were hoping this time also she would be able to come out of woods.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Finally, the inevitable happened on 14th October the auspicious day of Ekadashi according to the Indian calendar before the midday plunging Prashanti into the gloom!</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">After several discussions among the family members and the elders, it was decided very rightly that the final resting would be done in Prashanti only on the next day at 10.00am.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Every one in Prashanti wants to do what is that he or she can do which gives her the happiness and satisfaction. Just to give an example our bhajan group sat throughout the night singing the most favourite bhajans keertanas of thyagaraja filling the air with an unusual divinity. A team of youngsters went round the forest of Prashanti to get necessary bamboo and other wood and with their own hands prepared a nice platform to carry her. Electrician was also fully busy to light the place because already through out the evening and all through the night people were pouring to pay her their respects.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When, she was being taken round the path some one was commenting the flower garland around her is heavier than her body! Her physical body is so small that even the garland was heavier! Her food is as it is very little and especially on the last few days, she would only eat two or three spoons of beaten rice and nothing more! I always used to wonder those two spoons of food is running the whole living system and in addition she was also very alert and clear in her thinking. Two days before while she wanted to get up from sleeping position when i offered her to lift her up into upright position supporting at the back she said how much I am becoming burden to all; even i need to depend upon you for sitting up. Her weight on my hand was only few grams. But i wondered this lady through out life she has only been doing for the others and never asked anybody to do any ting for her.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The story goes back to several years – at least three generations. We don’t know nor we heard any thing about earlier generations, but what we heard is how unique was the life style of Venkatramaiah and his wife ‘Putta’ (every one used to call her by this name). Those days belonging to the middle class family they had a great combination of deep Indian culture and modern British knowledge of things like cleanliness, hygiene and knowledge of medicines and other things. They were complimentary to each other. He was generous to the people around and she was a great support to the women folk in their day to day problems. We heard stories like in the how disciplined the mother putta was and how generous father ventaramiah was! My sister who was staying in a house opposite to their house said that the best way of cooking of any food item, we have to learn it from Putta. The flower plants in their front garden were talk of that area. The ideas of healthy life they reflected even in the flower garden. Putta was so meticulous that their house was like a model house for every thing. They used to take every thing very seriously. As far as my knowledge goes the dedicated life of every member of this family can be traced to this divine couple Putta and Venkatramaiah</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">It is because of their Tapasya, god chose them to be the parents for three extraordinary children. The eldest is Ramarao engineer by training worked as lecturer in the local polytechnic college married to Lalitamma. Ramarao appeared very tough and hard from out side but people who knew them from near would know how soft and helping her was. As a lecturer, he would be ready to take all burdens of all his colleagues for any silly reason any time. He would make sure that all the students learn well and pass. On one occasion i went to his college with him twenty years after his retirement but I was surprised to see that all the staff members and the students touched his feet!</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The youngest is another brilliant child Seshadri who received early training and education at home with an idea that he could learn better than in school. Finally, when he has to go to school they tested him to admit in which standard he proved that he became the youngest in the class, topping every year. Finally, when he finished his masters with distinction he gave his certificates to his father and left home to give his life in service to the nation in the beginning inspired by Gandhiji and later he joined RSS and rose to the top popularly known as HV Seshadri. He remained unmarried. His life is also a life dedication and learning. A prolific writer and king maker, respected by everyone in the field of politics. Once when Seshadri was being honoured by citizens of Karnataka in a big function in front of several thousands of people Ramarao, elder brother of Sesahdri went there to see the function. He was standing on the last row enjoying the whole scene and he did not claim to be in front. This is one small example of his simplicity.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Ramaraoji’s wife Lalithamma is another wonderful woman. I heard that God chooses to be born in the womb of most innocent. I do not know about the innocence of Mother Mary or Kausalya but the most innocent woman I have come across is Lalithamma. That is the reason their children are one better than the other is. Five children, brilliant academically but equally dedicated for the cause of humanity. Boys, Dr Nagendra and Dr Venkatram are engineers and girls Dr Nagarathna is a into general medicine and Yoga therapy, and her sisters, Dr Rama Phanniraja and Dr Uma Bannerjee and both into gynaecology are highly qualified doctors, what else you want your children to be. If you look at Lalithamma, you can say she only deserves such children. Lalithamma is living in Prashanti along with the family of Prashanti. Dr Nagendra is the Vice chancellor of the Yoga University and Dr Nagarathna is the dean of faculty of medicine and yoga division and medical director of VYASA.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">After Ramarao the second one is daughter Lakshmi, very brilliant right from childhood. She wanted to become doctor to serve humanity. Her health in early childhood did not permit her to continue studies and she had to go to doctor’s office for the sake of her health, in the process, she herself became proficient in medical knowledge. What she wanted to become she accomplished in her brothers children. Remained unmarried, she felt that is a gift from god that she could spend all her life in the service activity and her dedication stands today as a Prashanti, which is the proof for her selfless work! Prashanti Kuteeram is her child and her spiritual sadhana.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Prashanti kuteeram stands for twin ideals one is its academic uniqueness and the other is the thrust and thirst for sadhana. If Dr Nagendra son of Lakshmi’s brother Ramarao is the person behind the academic achievement of Prashanti, the sadhana face of Prashanti is Lakshmi aunty. Until the last breath, her mind was on sadhana. The last dialogue I heard from her was about her concern for the students. She was enquiring for the feedback from the students whether the talk is sadhana oriented or not. The very next day, she is no more!</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">She had nothing to say about this is mine at the time of her death. Material possessions were almost nothing but her spiritual gain was unimaginable! One of the inmates of Prashanti has expressed this that her weight is reduced to that of a small child. Her life is an inspiration for many sadhakas. Swami visharadanandaji always used to say that one person whose every cell pours out spiritual sadhana is Lakshmi aunty.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Under the influence of Beloved Lakshmiji, Her brother Seshadriji, her brother Ramaraoji’s children Dr Nagendra Dr Nagarathna Dr Rama and Dr Uma and Dr Venkatram have happily given their services for the sake the spiritual culture and country! What can be greater achievement than this in ones life!</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Some one asked her, ‘do you want to be liberated from this cycle of birth and death which is normally the concept of Indian thinking’, and she replied negative. Her wish is to come back again and again and will request god to give her more and more strength so that she can serve more and more people in her next life.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Therefore, this Deepavali festival is the offering of our prayers for her soul and our prayers to her to guide us from wherever she is and to inspire us from time to time</span></span></p>","html":"<p><img align=\"top\" height=\"318.7\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/SuAh_SDXKQI/AAAAAAAAAxE/VXMHgvc-TCY/s1600/Aunty+Deepavali+Wish1.jpg\" width=\"425\"/></p>  \n\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I was initially thinking of writing about the Goddess Lakshmi, who is the Goddess for Deepavali or popularly known as Divali.

However, the case is not same for the plants for the simple reason plants are having life and therefore they have to organise self for the existence. Actually, the first form of life is the plant. The moment life is there as a part of its need for survival it has to organise itself for the survival.</div>\n<div>If you watch in order to see that, the work to take water from the earth in order to survive the plant sends its roots into the soil and sends its flowers and foliage into sky in order to spread itself into sun. We see in this arrangement also certain differences. Some plants have roots in the shape of our hair namely there is one stem and further there are several hundreds of small roots hanging from the stem itself. Where as there are some others plants and trees, which have one main stem which branches itself into two, root branches and they further divide into sub-sub branches into sub-sub branches.</div>\n<div>In these, also we can see two varieties. One variety is where the stem of the tree branches itself into a number of final sub branches. An example for this is the Tulsi plant. There is hardly any intermediate structural detains in between. This is sufficient for the Tulsi plant to live. This is a small plant. Its life is less than ten seasons.

However, the case is not same for the plants for the simple reason plants are having life and therefore they have to organise self for the existence. Actually, the first form of life is the plant. The moment life is there as a part of its need for survival it has to organise itself for the survival.</div>  \n\n<div>If you watch in order to see that, the work to take water from the earth in order to survive the plant sends its roots into the soil and sends its flowers and foliage into sky in order to spread itself into sun. We see in this arrangement also certain differences. Some plants have roots in the shape of our hair namely there is one stem and further there are several hundreds of small roots hanging from the stem itself. Where as there are some others plants and trees, which have one main stem which branches itself into two, root branches and they further divide into sub-sub branches into sub-sub branches.</div>  \n\n<div>In these, also we can see two varieties. One variety is where the stem of the tree branches itself into a number of final sub branches. An example for this is the Tulsi plant. There is hardly any intermediate structural detains in between. This is sufficient for the Tulsi plant to live. This is a small plant. Its life is less than ten seasons. By that time, the plant will give seeds and these seeds will help further propagation of these plants. The life of this plant is like five years max.</div>  \n\n<div>Another variety is where the root structure of the tree is different.

Indian society has always thought and planned everything in a very holistic way keeping in tune with the universe at large because of the expanded spiritual vision of the sages who were at the helm of affairs. We know that the nature is not ‘for man’ but we are a part of the nature. We survive on this planet not because of ‘me’ but because the nature has made life possible on this planet by providing the most congenial environment starting from the air, water and the right temperature. We live on this planet but we are not independent of our sun and moon or other planets and stars. We are in a web of life. Everything in this galaxy is influencing each other. Nothing can remain independent of the other. The living influences the non-living and vice versa. Scientists say that even the earth has life. Thus we cannot say that my mind and body can work totally independently. Our mind is the subtlest of the creation and has the maximum freedom as compared to all other things of this universe. Mind is the only stuff of this universe that has some freedom not to be bound by the laws that bind the universe. The freedom element that has crept into the human system during evolution has to make man recognize this great gift of nature and not tamper it. We are just realizing this over the past fifty years as to what havoc we have created in nature by thinking independent of nature and we are almost in a situation wherein we can completely destroy life on earth through global warming, depletion of ozone layer and creating a big imbalance in the eco system etc. This was simply because we forgot that we belong to the web and used the nature’s gift of ‘freedom’ as license to be self centered. Thus let us remember and realize that everything in this creation can influence each other. Mind being the most sensitive stuff of this universe it can be influenced to the maximum extent by the forces in nature. If you are sensitive and have the time to observe you can see that your mood varies with the rise and fall of the moon. It can influence your psychology. It is well known that psychological problems get aggravated on new moon and full moon days and hence the word ‘lunatic’ was coined.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Prediction as a science</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The influence of the celestial beings on our life events and behaviour are predictable and this developed in India as a science called astrology. Careful observations of the effect of all these celestial objects such as sun, moon, planets and stars on major and minor events of life became the topic of this science. They could go on to realize that the influence was due to our relationship with these stars in time and space. Thus it developed into a highly systematized science that could predict things based on the time of birth of the individual soul. Thus an astrologer can mathematically predict the life events both the past and the future. Astrology can also predict the nature and tendencies of behaviour of an individual soul. This ancient knowledge is available as palm leaf writings and is being used by astrologers today. A very interesting research is being done at this university by one of our PhD students. Dr Ramesh is a veterinary scientist and one of his major jobs is to vaccinate live stock and maintain the breed healthy until it goes to the slaughter house for human consumption. He is a very good astrologer too. He selected sheep and goat from his stock that was to be vaccinated for the first time. He divided them randomly into two groups A and B. A group received vaccination at a favorable time of the day as per the predictions from astrology and the B group at an unfavorable time. The results showed that the A group had higher antibody titers in their blood that persisted for a long time as compared to the B group which had lower quantity of antibody that dropped faster over the weeks of follow up. These results were statistically highly significant. This fascinating observation gives us scientific evidence for the influence of nature on animal systems. if the immune system of the animals can be influenced to this extent by the position of the animal in this universe at any given moment of time ,please think as to how much our mind and behaviour can be influenced by these external forces which we tend ignore completely and tend to tamper the mother nature.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">What is the basis of the science of predictions (astrology)?</span></span></span></strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">A society which developed its calendar based on the position of stars, planets and the galaxies (Indian calendar is the most accurate calendar even today), a society that could easily predict the rain fall of a particular place and the intensity of sun at a particular spot at a particular time based on the position of earth in relation to planets and stars, could calculate and categorize people based on their relationship with stars and planets. This is the beauty of astrology or numerology. The method adapted is first to create a mathematical matrix (called Kundali) of your position in relation with the planetary positions based on the date and time of your birth and go on with further calculations. Once we took our mother’s kundali to a very simple astrologer. He did not even show any interest in talking to us or enquiring anything about us. He just sat down , looked at the kundali , took a piece of paper and drew his own matrix and did some mathematical calculations and within three minutes started saying many things about our mother’s life as to when she got married, how many children she has had, how many are surviving etc. What fascinated us the most was he continued and said ‘your mother has had a fracture of the bone in her right thigh region between such and such a date and this repeated on two occasions between two dates’. In fact we were highly impressed at how these calculations were accurate when we verified the dates on her X rays after we returned home. How could he do it? These calendars and astrological calculations are fascinating and hence has become a big business today in India.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The Indian society used these predictions systematically before venturing into any major events of life such as marriage or taking up a major business etc. This science would give accurate predictions whether the marriage would be successful and helpful for the society at large and for the individuals based on the characteristics revealed from the calculations. The calculations would even give the right time to get married or start a business. If you remember the life of Buddha the astrologers predicted at the time of birth that he will become a great monk. His father took all precautions not to expose him to the outside world and bring him up in a royal atmosphere. But the nature of Buddha was so strong that he went on to become one of the greatest monks who served many more people than what he could have done as a king. Astrology therefore is specialized mathematics.

I simply wondered at her ability.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">- to be continued&hellip;</span></span></span></em></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Predictions as a Science -4-","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":52,"uuid":"00082d2c-4887-425f-8b01-c36fd3e91972","title":"Happy birthday!","slug":"happy-birthday","markdown":"<div align=\"center\"><img align=\"top\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/SmRnSt8hzbI/AAAAAAAAAwA/Apo8GnoHtuo/s1600/happy+birthday.gif\" width=\"270\"/></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\">Dear all,<br/><br/>Please join us wishing a very happy 61st birthday to our beloved guru, Sri NV Raghuramji.<br/><br/>With love&hellip;</div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n<div align=\"left\"><strong>Message from Raghuramji:</strong></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"center\"></div>\n<div align=\"left\">Subject: DHANYAVADAH OR THANKS</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Date: July 23, 2009</div>\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\n<div align=\"left\">I would like to express my sincere thanks and loves to hundreds of greetings i received who i can not reply individually but please take it as my personal thanks to one and all from all over the world.</div>\n<div align=\"left\">It is all your good wishes prayers and sincere support that we could accomplish whatever we could do.</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Your love is my health and energy!!</div>\n<div align=\"left\">love,</div>\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\n<div align=\"left\">raghuram</div>","html":"<div align=\"center\"><img align=\"top\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/SmRnSt8hzbI/AAAAAAAAAwA/Apo8GnoHtuo/s1600/happy+birthday.gif\" width=\"270\"/></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\">Dear all,<br/><br/>Please join us wishing a very happy 61st birthday to our beloved guru, Sri NV Raghuramji.<br/><br/>With love&hellip;</div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<p><br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><br/><br/></p>  \n\n<div align=\"left\"><strong>Message from Raghuramji:</strong></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"center\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">Subject: DHANYAVADAH OR THANKS</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">Date: July 23, 2009</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">I would like to express my sincere thanks and loves to hundreds of greetings i received who i can not reply individually but please take it as my personal thanks to one and all from all over the world.</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">It is all your good wishes prayers and sincere support that we could accomplish whatever we could do.</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">Your love is my health and energy!!</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">love,</div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\"></div>  \n\n<div align=\"left\">raghuram</div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Happy birthday!","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-07-20T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-07-20T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-07-20T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":53,"uuid":"21987dfb-6f79-495d-9894-ee1b989ce12d","title":"Predictions as a Science -3-","slug":"predictions-as-a-science-3","markdown":"<p><strong>Social structure for healthy nurture:</strong><br/><br/><span>Let us for the time being leave the extraordinary talents aside and understand the common person who may not manifest any special talents in his life. Every person has some interest of his own right from childhood which the parents may also encourage. As the child grows he sees some great people who are highly successful in that field and he also reads about the life of people who attempted and became a failure. On one side he is inspired by the people who are successful but develops enormous fear of failure looking at the bigger number of people who failed. Many a times the influence of people who failed cast such great fear in parents they tend to become overcautious. That is why most people’s advices are very defensive. They say follow the middle path and do not venture into adventures.</span><br/><span>The wonderful hereditary occupation based caste system took care of this. It gave a wonderful opportunity for the child to flower out its talents without these fears of failure. The system was so carefully organized that it could help every one to grow in the right direction with pride. In this system, society was divided into four types (castes) Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra. The Brahmanas to carry out the intellectual functions as a teacher in all walks (both worldly and spiritual knowledge) and his duty was to protect the human value systems of the society as a guide to all other sections of the society. Hence he had to live a life of austerity with regular spiritual and yoga practices so that he could remain in tune with higher laws of nature and guide the society in the right direction. The Kshatriyas were the kings with enormous administrative skills and had to nurture physical valor, intelligence for strategic planning and the pride of protecting the entire community including the Brahmins. Trade and business was the occupation of the Vaishya community. Shudras were craftsmen (Blacksmith, goldsmith, architect, house keeping etc) and constituted the larger section of the society who had the responsibility to implement every thing through hard work and labor. When the system was designed this way there was no choice for the child born in one family to think of any new occupation that would create fear. This facilitated the person to get the necessary training right from his childhood .Over generations the skills of the family would snowball to move towards excellence. Thus, when a soul with a particular talent chose to enter the womb of the mother and took birth in that family the opportunities to express the talent were so congenial that the journey of the soul would become very easy. It facilitated a natural and systematic evolution and the child could easily find the opportunity to carry on further research in the same field of activity which his father was doing. Thus a doctor’s child could easily become a better doctor with some new innovations, a king’s son had the opportunity to be a better king and so on and so forth. Thus there was a vertical and horizontal matrix created so that there was social harmony. Every village therefore had all these four castes catering the needs of all types of people through clearly defined duties for each family group. This arrangement gave a very deep alignment in every individual and left no adolescent in a state of insecurity as it is happening today. In India today after the materialism and the foreign rule took over we have lost this system completely to the extent that we blame the caste system for the entire decline that India went through over the past two centuries. There was a systematic intellectual planning and brain washing by the British to erase this strongly protected system of the Indian society. The brain washing was done by introducing the concept of ‘high and low’ in this caste system. They used it as a strategy to win over the Indian minds and succeeded to rule India. This has become so much ingrained into the Indian system today that an adolescent feels ashamed to continue his father’s occupation and wants to venture into something different, more challenging, and more adventurous and ends up with the fear of failure. He loses his wonderful opportunity that was provided naturally through the family tradition. Modern management researchers from UK and Harvard are trying to study this caste system that had protected the Indian society over centuries.</span><br/><span>This caste system was evolved taking into consideration the basic tendencies and preferences of a person which is called ‘gunas’. Let us now understand this concept of ‘triguna’ the three gunas that is necessary for balance and harmony in the society.</span><br/><br/><strong>The law of triguna<br/></strong><br/><span>It is very interesting to see how our ancient people of wisdom understood the creation as a whole in Sankhya philosophy. This is the concept of tri gunas which is translated roughly as three basic qualities. Using this concept of ‘guna’ we can divide the entire creation under three types. Creation includes not only the objects but animals human beings food and even the activity. Every thing in this creation, sentient and insentient, can be classified under three categories (gunas) namely Satva, Rajas and Tamas. We can understand this in this way that every plant has three components they are roots in the soil, the stem or trunk of the plant or the tree in between and the flowers fruits and foliage in the sky. The roots are tamas, the trunk is the rajas and the flowers and foliage is the satva. Accordingly since the roots are always in the darkness the darkness is called tamas, since the trunk is protecting the plant and constantly working in distributing the sap and organizing every thing of the plant in the place these kind of activities are also called as rajas, and finally the flowers and foliage are soft and colorful and having nice fragrance etc these qualities are called as satva. The roots are always in the soil and feed on the slush and dirt and the roots are tamas therefore the food which is petrified and causes dullness is all categorized into tamas. Tamas is also dullness and gravity. Dull and slow animals are called as tamas and aggressive type of animals are called rajas and the food they take are also called as rajas and those animals who are soft and gentle these animals are called as satva. Similarly the people in the society can be divided very systematically based on their deep inner nature or the gunas into satva rajas and tamas. These gunas are not arbitrary divisions in case of human beings but they are based on very deep inner psychology of a person and left to themselves what their predominant behavior.</span><br/><span>Every individual is a combination of these three gunas in different proportions. Every individual like every plant has all the three gunas. In human beings they are in some proportion with one of the gunas predominating. Like his feet are tamas which carry the weight of the body all the time and goes through rough terrain, his stomach heart and the middle portion of the body is rajas which is constantly distributing the energy through out the body and is constantly working without any rest or respite and the head which is responsible for thinking and scheming and planning is satva. In the same way what happens in side of the body the human being also decides based on the gunas what he has to do outside. At different times he manifests one guna or the other depending on the requirement. Thus guna governs most of what we do. Let me explain this. When anyone is tired and needs sleep he resorts to his tamas guna so that he can enjoy his sleep. The same person when he has to think or plan for any activity he takes to satva whose very nature is analyzing and thinking. One may think of just simple travel he has to make or a big activity like planning an industry. Both involve thinking. Both involve satva. Similarly one uses rajas when he needs to get exited or irritated or perform intense activity. A harmonious blend of these gunas is a state of perfect balance and health. None of us are perfect in this mastery and blend of the gunas and we all have some predominance of one or two of these gunas. When this is used in the right way with mastery then the life goes on with health and happiness. For example if a person is predominately satvic then he would spend his time happily in doing satvic activities that involves thinking and soft emotions. He may be a scientist or a teacher. This kind of work would give him fulfillment according to his guna.</span><br/><span>In Sanskrit language a ‘man’ is called PURUSHA which is Puri + isha. Puri means a city or a country and ‘isha’ means ‘the master’. Thus the body is the city in which we live as a master. Just like the body is a living organ the city is also a living system. Just like these three gunas are used by the person to carry on all activities of the body all activities of the social system also goes on with harmonious blending of these three gunas. Only when all these gunas are used efficiently and harmoniously the city can be healthy. In order to carry on these activities we require people who are having those qualities and will enjoy doing those activities. Thus we have people who are predominantly satvic and those who are predominantly rajasic and those who are predominantly tamasic in nature and they manage these activities according to their gunas and the society will grow harmoniously. The satva predominant families who were the teachers and spiritual masters were classified as Brahmins ; Vaishyas who looked after trade and business were also predominantly satvic persons with an additional component of rajas that was necessary for travel and hard work of carrying the goods etc. Kshatriyas’ duties were to protect righteousness and be physically and mentally very strong and hence were predominantly rajasic people. Shudras who were a combination of tamas and rajas were assigned the job of carrying on the routine duties in the society. </span><br/><span>We saw the play of gunas in the society and human beings. Every thing else in nature sentient or insentient, are also made of these gunas. The sages said that all these gunas are necessary for the creation to continue. What is necessary is a wonderful harmony in these gunas. The beautiful blend of these gunas is ensured by the laws that govern the entire creation. This is the programmed functioning of the creative or cosmic intelligence (Ishwara or God) which we see in the universe starting from inanimate things that follow the laws of physics and also the living systems that follow biological (Darwinian) laws. But as we evolved as human species nature bestowed us with higher faculties of the mind that has introduced the wonderful component of freedom and mastery over these laws. By wrong usage of this freedom we have successfully messed up the programmed functioning of these gunas. We have succeeded in posing a big problem to even the creator! As long as a human being accepts and functions according to his or her nature then there will be no problem. But trying to tamper this balance by misusing the mastery over these basic qualities or gunas it can create a major imbalance within leading to diseases or in the whole society creating social and environmental problems. When one tries to imitate others and takes up jobs or activities that does not suit his/her nature then problems arise.</span><br/><span>Until recently (150 years back) in India we had a well planned society and the caste system was functional. The education, occupation, and their contribution to the society were well defined and beautifully set based on their gunas. That way the society also had at any point of time people working the jobs which was harmonious to their nature and which is also required in the society. there were always competent rulers doing the rajasic work of ruling and competent intellectuals to carry n the satvic work of advising thinking and inventing and businessmen doing the rajasic work of distributing the material wealth and those who are tamas predominance who could happily do the labor work. With such an arrangement the society was very harmonious. This harmony was helpful for the future evolution of an individual during the next birth too. For example a person in a Brahmin community will have deep rooted impressions which are in harmony with Brahmin practices and when such a person dies the soul does not have to struggle for searching a suitable family to be born. The soul will be able to choose very easily another Brahmin family. This understanding of the gunas that control the whole of the universe and our human system was so good that people started evolving a method of predicting how, where and when a child will be born and what will be the tendencies of the person even from the time of its birth and developed into a big science. The soul would not be confused to choose parents and come back to take birth. I wonder we pay a great importance to select a dog or a horse and look at its father and mother for several generations but when we choose a boy or girl we do not look into what are their immediate parents. According to ancient Indian system the soul will look at the parents before choosing the birth.</span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><strong>Social structure for healthy nurture:</strong><br/><br/><span>Let us for the time being leave the extraordinary talents aside and understand the common person who may not manifest any special talents in his life.

I receive Dr. David Frawley&rsquo;s online newsletter from the American Institute of Vedic Studies. This past month there was an article about the founder of the system of Yoga. I found this article a bit confusing and was wondering if the Hiranyagarbha that he refers to could have been a Sage or does he really mean that Hiranyagarbha, the Cosmic Egg, is the founder? I understand that Patanjali was the compiler of the sutras, but as Dr. Frawley points out, many have not given much thought to the founder. You are very knowledgeable about such things and would very much like to get your opinion </span><a href=\"http://www.vedanet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=2\">on this article. </a><br/><span>With humble regards&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer: </strong><br/><span>Vedas contain all the knowledge in some form or the other. many times the idea may be ther for a person of insight to elaborate. it is not only yoga but all the possible knowledges such as dance music, art and architecture, social structure and what not every thing is availble in Vedas.</span><br/><span>Certainly Patanjali existed only after Mahabharata etc, he was little before Adi Shankaracharya. But the credit goes to Patanjali for codifying in aphorisms. Sutras are to be undestood by one in the way he is convinced and he gets help in his personal sadhana. This is true not only to Yoga sutras but also to Brahma sutras and Bhakti sutras. Therefore you can find many different ways they are being interpreted. </span><br/><span>As far as I read Gita Hiranya garbha the golden or treasure womb is the treasure of all, which is essentially divided as knowledge and and expression. in this knowledge we have this yoga sastra too. Therefore krishna refers to Hiranyagarbha as the unmanifest form of all the creation.</span><br/><span>in my view there is no one person with a name of Hiranya garbha.

I receive Dr. David Frawley&rsquo;s online newsletter from the American Institute of Vedic Studies. This past month there was an article about the founder of the system of Yoga. I found this article a bit confusing and was wondering if the Hiranyagarbha that he refers to could have been a Sage or does he really mean that Hiranyagarbha, the Cosmic Egg, is the founder? I understand that Patanjali was the compiler of the sutras, but as Dr. Frawley points out, many have not given much thought to the founder. You are very knowledgeable about such things and would very much like to get your opinion </span><a href=\"http://www.vedanet.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=2\">on this article. </a><br/><span>With humble regards&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer: </strong><br/><span>Vedas contain all the knowledge in some form or the other. many times the idea may be ther for a person of insight to elaborate. it is not only yoga but all the possible knowledges such as dance music, art and architecture, social structure and what not every thing is availble in Vedas.</span><br/><span>Certainly Patanjali existed only after Mahabharata etc, he was little before Adi Shankaracharya. But the credit goes to Patanjali for codifying in aphorisms. Sutras are to be undestood by one in the way he is convinced and he gets help in his personal sadhana. This is true not only to Yoga sutras but also to Brahma sutras and Bhakti sutras. Therefore you can find many different ways they are being interpreted. </span><br/><span>As far as I read Gita Hiranya garbha the golden or treasure womb is the treasure of all, which is essentially divided as knowledge and and expression. in this knowledge we have this yoga sastra too. Therefore krishna refers to Hiranyagarbha as the unmanifest form of all the creation.</span><br/><span>in my view there is no one person with a name of Hiranya garbha. It only means that the knowledge comes form silence abd bliss absolute.

Om peace, peace, peace!</span><br/><br/><span>This is a very simple prayer applicable to one and all. Millions and millions of Indians have been offering this prayer for last five thousand and odd years. The prayer is so simple that one can easily remember the simple meaning as ‘ may all be happy and healthy’. As we go into the depth of its meaning there is lot more to understand about the psyche of the sages who offered this universal prayer which is wholesome, all encompassing, purely socialistic and highly spiritual. It brings out the uniqueness of a spiritual master who develops enormous love for the entire creation so that he not only does whatever best he can do for others and also offers prayer to the higher forces that are beyond one’s control .Thus, this prayer is not just a simple prayer but becomes a mantra, a goal for a sadhaka (spiritual seeker) to meditate upon and move on in the path of spiritually to achieve universality. Let us dwell on these thoughts in. Today’s satsang .</span><br/><br/><strong>Why do we need to pray?<br/></strong><span>Before I go on to explain the meaning of the mantra, let me give you an example from Mahabharata to show how the great warrior Bhishma was a living example (now there is enough proof through archeological studies that mahabharata is a history and not just an imagination of a poet) of this Indian (Hindu) advise that ‘we only have the right to pray for others and never for seeking favours for ourselves’. This is brought out beautifully by the poet through Bhishma’s own statement in the warfare.</span><br/><span>When every one had assembled for war at Kurukshetra, Krishna and Arjuna stood in the battle field discussing about the vital questions of life which turned out to be Bhagavad-Gita, the divine hymn, an all time message for humanity at large. Although the conches were already blown with full readiness for the orders from the leaders , the entire army had to wait and could not start off the war as Bhishma the senior of the two captains did not give the orders. The restless Duryodhana asks Bhishma ‘what is happening there? What are they discussing in the middle of the battle field? Why don’t you give the orders to start off?” Bhishma in turn replies ‘My dear son, let us wait for a few moments to start the destruction. They must be discussing some thing important’. Duryodhana says with arrogance, “Oh, what else could it be, I know it! Arjuna must be terrified looking at our army and he must be discussing how to run away from the war field!’. Bhishma replies to Duryodhana, “Why do you want to show off you ignorance.” and adds, “in all my life, I have never prayed for any favour for myself; whatever was given to me I accepted wholeheartedly. Only at this moment I feel like praying to wind God to blow towards me so that a few of those divine words of wisdom pouring out from Krishna’s lips may fall on my ears”. . This shows how great masters like Bhishma were living examples of this prayer that we only have the right to pray for others and not for self and it had percolated as a living culture of the Indian society. Thus, this prayer that carries such a great message has been sung and chanted heartily all over on this Indian soil over five thousand and odd years for the welfare of ALL.</span><br/><span>In the first place one may ask ‘what is the need for a spiritual master who has mastered all laws of nature, to pray to Gods (higher forces of creative intelligence), either for himself or for other? This is because the sage who has gone through this highest experience of oneness of the universal consciousness or self realization knows that praying is the mode and tool to manifest that experience and compassion for the fellow beings. In fact you will realize through your own experience that we cannot really change a person, unless he wants to, except to pray and pray for his or her well being which can fructify if done with full sincerity and integrity. You know that happiness is not something that you can get by possessions of material things. One may possess every thing one can think of that is meant to give happiness, but he may be the most miserable person. Money or position or power or authority can never ensure happiness. In fact, with a small introspective observation of the society and friends around you, you will realize that these two are not connected to each other at all. I am sure you have come across many people who do not have any luxurious possessions and do not have big laurels to their credit and live a very simple life, but they are very happy .You can see the pure genuine smile on their faces always. You also have examples of persons who have every luxury you ask for, but the happiness is not there. A person who is poor but unhappy, at least has a hope that one day he can find money and that he would become happy in future by satisfying his wants. But a person who has tons of money but is not happy is all the more miserable because he does not even have this hope that money can bring happiness. Similarly, the so called educated and knowledgeable person can be much more unhappy than an uneducated and ignorant person!. Upanishad goes on to unravel this truth systematically to reach the right understanding. These sages realized that real happiness is to ‘Know’ that ‘I’ am made of the stuff called ‘Ananda or happiness’ and also that ‘prayer’ is a wonderful tool to tap this divine happiness for one and all. Thus, having realized that satisfying the material wants of an individual cannot give the lasting happiness, what else can a sage who is established in this eternal happiness do as an expression of the great compassion that he nurtures for the fellow beings? How can he express his universal love? How can we the mortals who have not yet attained that highest experience of eternal happiness culture ourselves? Only thing any one can do is to pray that may every one be happy!</span><br/><span>Seeds contain the entire tree within them. Just this knowledge about its potentiality is of no use. You should allow it to express itself as the fully grown tree by preparing the soil and providing the necessary nourishment. If you do not prepare the ground and give the right type of environment the seed cannot sprout and yield a healthy and useful tree. In addition to this, once the sprouts have come up, it is also very important to deweed the wrong sprouts around. Prayer is like weeding out the wrong sprouts. It is important to carry on our duties with utmost care and efficiency and then the prayer works by deweeding the unseen obstacles. Rishis give these prayers with love, compassion and deep concern. But the prayers do not eliminate the need of our efforts to work with efficiency and commitment. Prayer is not for a lazy person.. Now, with this understanding let us try to understand the ideas in this prayer “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah…”</span><br/><br/><strong>‘May every one be happy…’</strong><br/><span>Every one here refers to the entire creation, to all sensuous beings including plants, animals and human beings. Although this prayer is in Sanskrit and though this is given in the so called Hindu scriptures, when the sages say “sarve…” they do not exclude non- Hindus. The prayer does not say, I pray God to give happiness to Hindus only and you do not deserve my prayers if you are not a Hindu!</span><br/><span>Some times the religious institutions can be so narrow that the God you believe in may be the same, the heaven and hell are the same, and the prophet also is the same, but you cannot pray for the well being of people of other sects. One of my Christian friends was saying that when she was a young girl in US, the church school she was going to, taught her that they are supposed to pray only for those who go to that particular church and those who are associated with other churches do not deserve their prayers. She realized the shallowness of this when she grew up, but for many of her friends this remained as a belief for life time! Religious fundamentalists in every religion have been responsible for creating such illogical unhealthy beliefs and even wars have been waged for protecting such doctrines. This is rampant even today when we are in this 21st century of science and technology, when man is considered to be dominated by logical thinking. Thus we see that our prayer shall reach every one , every human being, every one belonging to all religions, all castes, all creeds, all races, all animals and all plants not only on this planet but to all living beings on any planet in the galaxy. Then a question arises as to why we should pray for the protection and well being of bad people? Is it not important that we protect the good and destroy the bad? Does it not appear very logical that we pray only for protection of the good?</span><br/><br/><strong>No one is bad by birth</strong><br/><span>When the sage is saying ‘sarve…’ he is so large hearted that he includes not only the believers of God but those who do not believe in God. One may believe in god but he may be totally anti-social and inhuman, but on the other hand one may be a non=believer of God but very highly spiritual. Therefore the prayer does not exclude the non-believers of God!. This mantra says that we are supposed to pray for the well being of every one including the good and the bad, the lazy and the hard worker, a burglar and a savior or the downtrodden and the knowledgeable , Sarve…. therefore appears to be beyond all differentiations and denominations. How can the intellect accept this idea ‘May the good people be happy and the bad people also be happy!’ If good people are kept happy, they will continue to do good, but if the bad people are happy then they will continue to be bad. Only if they are unhappy or suffer then they have some chance of becoming good. This is the simple logic which appears to be the basis on which we have created courts and prisons to punish the bad and protect the good to maintain social peace.. This concept believes that if the criminals suffer tortures in the prison cell, then he will change into a good man. Hence the persons who manage the prison are trained to be cruel in their appearance and behaviour. I have never seen any prison myself but that is what is shown in the movies!</span><br/><span>Let us ask ourselves as to how many criminals have changed truly through these prisons and tortures? . We know that, a person who has been a criminal out side and who has never gone to a prison may have some fear about the life in the jail and the torture he has to face but once who has come back from the jail he will not even that fear any more. Not only that, once he is in jail he will have an opportunity to see several people who are more professional than himself and he would have had an opportunity to learn more tricks of committing crimes without getting caught. Out side they may to have had gurus to guide them, but once they are in side there are maha- gurus to guide them in many more tricks of the trade! Do you think cheating can not go on within the prison? One can pretend to be an obedient inmate, so that he can cleverly escape difficult jobs.</span><br/><span>This I have seen happening in many Ashrams, churches, organizations and amongst politicians too. In Ashramas , if you are close to the chief guru, you can be exempted from waking up early in the morning and sitting for meditation sessions like other inmates of the ashram!</span><br/><span>.Nadir Shah, the emperor was known to be some one who used to invent new types of tortures for the criminals every day. He thought that this may stop people from revolting against him. There is a story about him that once he asked his minister, ‘they say sleeping for long hours is bad for health according to scientists; is it true?’ The minister replied , “sir, the scientists’ findings are true in case of ordinary people but you are an exception .This does not apply to you, In your case the longer you sleep and lesser you are awake, the more healthy people will be!”</span><br/><br/><span>Thus, you can understand that, the fear of punishment may not change a person to become a good man and in fact it can make him worse. It is all hypothetical to say that punishment can change a bad person to become good. Of course it is necessary to punish the wicked and keep them away from the society so that they will not team up to destroy the entire society. But for individuals or groups to change we need a different approach. . These days revolutionary thinkers and reformers of prisons like Ms Kiran Bedi of Tihar jail or Mr Vyavahareji of Vivekananda Yoga research foundation, teachers of Sri Sri Ravishankar who teach the ‘art of living program’ etc have successfully introduced methods of vipassana meditation, and yoga in prisons with positive results of real change in these criminals . There are examples of a few of these criminals who have taken to teaching yoga and leading a respectable life in the society after they came out of the prison..</span><br/><span>Hence, this assumption that ‘bad people will become good through unhappiness’ does not seem to have a solid foundation. In addition, saying that good should be happy and bad should not be happy presupposes the idea that basically there are two different categories of people namely originally good and originally bad people. This also is not true by the simple logic that good people can turn bad and vice versa over time. How can we think that God creates originally good people and bad people! Why do you think that God would create some one bad? Is it by chance that some one is good? Is the creator partial to someone? How can we accept a universal creative intelligent being which is very partial to be ‘the God’?! Some religions posit other assumptions to explain this discrepancy that we see in the world. They say that God created good people and Satan created bad people! All these assumptions are so illogical that it cannot be the truth.</span><br/><span>According to the sages this prayer has a deep presupposition that by birth every one is good. If so, then why do we have bad people in the society? Why some people create problems to others? Why are there people like Hitler? </span><br/><span>God has not created any one originally bad or good. In their original nature every one has only goodness as his true nature. The real self, the “I”, the auspicious being, the changeless, the basic stuff of this universe made of Ananda is free from any taint of badness. Hence every one in their true nature is good and it is only the situations that make men behave badly. The difficult circumstances have forced them to become bad. In the given circumstances they found it so difficult to survive as good people and it pushed them to become bad as he had no other choice for survival. Even a bad guy, is only bad in his business hours and tries to be good wherever possible and expects others to be good to him. Even the worst of the criminal, a dacoit, wants his subordinates not to tell him a lie or be disloyal to him. Most of the Indian movies on any criminals show how caring he is for his mother, wife and children and can do anything to protect them.</span><br/><span>Intuitively, can you not feel this goodness in everyone? I do not think it requires any great spiritual master to tell you this .This is the reason that when you happen to get introduced to a new person for the first time ,you spontaneously greet him and say, “hello, nice to meet you or good to meet you!!”, even before you have known anything about the person. This is the wonderful expression of the positivity that you are able to see in the stranger about whom your mind has not yet formed any opinion&hellip; You never greet a person in a negative tone and not even in a neutral tone. It is spontaneously positive .You will never say, “ok, I am meeting you now, let me decide later on after some time whether it is nice to meet you or not!” At the outset you presume that he is good and only later when you find out that he has many unacceptable qualities you may change your opinion. Even then we need not say that the person is bad. You will only conclude that this person’s behaviour is not acceptable to ‘me’ and to the society at large.</span><br/><br/><strong>Seeing good in every one is the beginning of spiritual journey</strong><br/><span>You start a great spiritual journey when you nurture these spontaneous expressions that are inbuilt into our system and make it a Sadhana that you will consciously dwell on this thought that’ every one is good’. You don’t have to be defensive. The very thought that every one is good irrespective of gender, religion, colour or creed, brings out the feeling that every one belongs to me. You start recognizing that everyone is ‘my own ‘. And there is no need to be defensive about the people and society around you&hellip; This simply paves way to peaceful coexistence. It will add strength to your personality and makes you feel secure. When you think of goodness all the time, then all good aspects of your personality such as love and compassion, sharing and caring become visible and you get controlled by these good qualities&hellip; On the other hand when you become defensive you start looking at all the wonderful qualities in a person with suspicion. When we assume a positive attitude, the world becomes a heaven the same world appears to be a hell if you look at this with a negative attitude. Just because you want to look at things in positive attitude it does not mean that you could be careless and reckless. Chanakya says you lock the house not because the people around you are thieves but let your unlocked house not tempt people to become bad.. We don’t require to be policing the so called bad people all the time. On the other hand when you approach them with love, care and concern and pray for their well being, there are better chances that they change to become good people.</span><br/><span>Another question that you may ask is,’ if every one is good, then why do we have bad people around us? Why do we have criminals all over?’We have already answered this. To start with, a person was made good, but when he could not cope up with circumstances, he must have felt that he has exhausted all the fair means of overcoming the intense distress and was left with only one choice-either to take to wrong means or commit suicide. He did not know that he had yet another choice, a third option. He is stuck with the wrong notion that the cause of his unhappiness is the world around and the people around him. With this wrong notion, when he faces difficult situations and cannot come out as a successful happy person, he decides to take revenge on the society that caused the problem by torturing or disturbing or creating unhappiness to others. Generally this tends to show up as a torture for the innocent and the gentle ones in the society. Do you think he would have turned to be a bad person if he did not have to face such difficult situations? We said there is a third option that could have helped him to continue to be good. What is this? This is the notional correction; a cognitive correction; a correction at the level of perceiving the situation in an entirely opposite way; i.e. to recognize the inbuilt freedom to change your perception of the situation and correct the wrong notions about happiness and unhappiness itself. To understand this and find a permanent solution requires a small twist in the question. This shift in the question provides the answer. It removes the root of all distress and unhappiness. What is that shift? Ask yourself ‘what is unhappiness?’ instead of ‘what makes me unhappy?’ Or ask ‘what is happiness? Instead of asking “what makes me happy?”</span><br/><br/><strong>What is Happiness?</strong><br/><span>No prayer will give happiness. Nothing from out side can give you happiness. No out side situation can give us sorrow too. If out side can give us happiness the same out side can take away our happiness too. No outside agency has the authority on you more than you have. Out side can only create good or bad situations, but whether the situation makes you happy or unhappy is in your hands. The sage is one who has realized that he is the master. His prayers are therefore his wishes. He wants every one to realize this truth. He is not going to more happy or less happy by this prayer. It is his heart’s wish and enormous love for the creation that pours out in this form. Then it becomes a mantra.</span><br/><br/><strong>Unhappiness is a learnt habit</strong><br/><span>Our wrong understanding has given us unhappiness. For example, we feel very unhappy when we do not win in any game or feel miserable when some one gets more points. Playing any game is actually is meant for recreation and at the end of the game winners are happy and losers are miserable. It is obvious that all can not win. We forget that playing a game was for recreation and as a part of the game we created teams and rules etc. If we are not caught up in success or failure then we can always be happy. I watched a tennis game wherein the loser was so happy and cheerful that the winner became confused and dazed and lost his happiness. The crowd in the gallery turned and cheered up the loser as they found it very strange! Thus the loser won the hearts of the spectators than the winner.</span><br/><br/><strong>Unhappiness is a learnt habit.</strong><br/><span>As parents, we have created higher value for unhappiness in the minds of our children. We create the feeling in the child even before he knows any thing about the world that we love him and care for him only if he is unhappy or at least he shows he is unhappy and he is suffering. Only when the child is suffering then the mother leaves every work to take care of the child. The child learns that if he is happy the mother has no time for him at all! Dad will talk only when he is sick! If the child falls but is not hurt then the parents brush it aside. But if he cries for the hurt, then the parents are with him all the time. This way, unconsciously we are giving the message to the child that if you have to be important then you have to be sick and suffering. When he comes back from the school happily and shows no strain then he is not paid attention. On the other hand if the child shows he is tired and exhausted then he receives a lot of care. This message is used after he grows up also. The husband working in a government department comes back home tired and exhausted whether he works or not. These days in government offices who does any work? Every work in every country is out sourced! Then wife will come to him to take off his shoes and she serves him fresh coffee. Thing come to him&hellip; He has all sympathies. If the same person comes back home normal and not tired then he will only hear an instructions about where the milk is, where the sugar is etc and he has to fix his own coffee. Same thing happens to the wife too. She has also understood the trick of the trade. Child may have behaved very fine through out the day. But when the husband returns home, she has to show that she is exhausted taking care of the child whole day so that she deserves his sympathies! I therefore tell people that I and my wife have equally shared the burden of work and responsibilities this way. “She is busy and I look busy”!</span><br/><span>Another peculiar concept is ingrained in our minds right from our childhood. If one is happy for some time then he has to face unhappiness immediately after that. We are all the time</span><br/><span>living in the fear of unhappiness when we see a child happy and joyfully playing; we say ‘oh, now child is laughing so much that certainly it is going to cry soon’. If a child drops some thing on the floor and the thing breaks then it gets scolding but if the child breaks it and also cries, it gets sympathetic remarks from the parents! When we have given so much value for suffering, how can we expect that one can be happy always under all circumstances? Everywhere suffering has gained an upper hand and therefore it is hard to believe that every one should be happy and could be happy always.</span><br/><span>There is a difficulty in the education we give to the child. On one side we expect the child to get all top marks and top ranking in every thing he takes up. Even if he gets the second position, every one around him starts questioning why he did not get the first position? The child hears this so frequently that he feels his life is useless because he did not stand first. We forget that in every class only one person can be the first one and the rest are losers and every loss can make one miserable.</span><br/><span>Even the so called spiritual practices have also given too much importance to suffering. If you torture others, law is there to punish you but if you torture yourself then the society respects you as great spiritual person. When we portray the lives of great spiritual masters also, we tend to emphasize the torture they have undergone in their Sadhana. Talking about Buddha, I heard someone saying how much torture it was that he was not even getting enough food to eat and he had to go through so much humiliation etc. I am sure Buddha never felt that it was a torture or distress to go for alms. His only goal was to find what is there after death and this was so intense that nothing could disturb him. Buddha’s focus was some thing different and the emphasis given by the onlookers about his Sadhana was different. About Ramakrishna and Sharada Devi also people take so much joy in portraying as if it was a life of torture. If you torture others you will be prosecuted whereas if you torture yourself you will be decorated. What we need to learn from the life of these saints is that, being happy or unhappy does not depend on the circumstances and what appears to be torturous need not make you unhappy. If one wants to be unhappy and tortures himself then no one can help him and he will continue to be unhappy. Hence it is not the circumstance that is making us unhappy but it is the learnt habit of responding to the situation that has made us suffer and be unhappy. Thus, Sarve bhavantu sukhinah is essentially said to remove the wrong notion that suffering is valuable.</span><br/><br/><span>Does this mean that a spiritual seeker should not be looking for comfort? Even the notion that comfort will give me happiness is as wrong as suffering takes you close to spirituality. Material can not give any thing. Simplifying life is the essence of spirituality and not to subject to self torture! Dukha or suffering can not give us spirituality; therefore let us aspire for every one to be happy through this prayer Sarvebhavantu sukhinah.</span><br/><span>Let me sum up the ideas about happiness. Let us not have a wrong value for unhappiness and let us also not be confused that happiness can be achieved from out side or given by some one else. The sage realized that happiness is his true nature and he has a compassionate appeal and prays ’may everyone realize this truth’ that ‘happiness is my true eternal unchanging nature’.</span><br/><br/><strong>Freedom from sickness</strong><br/><span>Next sentence in the prayer is Sarve Santu Niramayah meaning ‘May every one be free from sicknesses.</span><br/><span>In Sanskrit we have a very interesting word for health. It is Swastha or Swaasthya, which means ‘to stay in oneself’ or ‘being oneself’. It implies that when you are Swastha, you are in total harmony with yourself which means that you have realized your original nature that ‘you are made of the stuff called happiness’. Thus, if health can be defined as being in oneself, then it is obvious that sickness or unhappiness is, being away from oneself. Thus our original nature is to be blissful and unhappiness is something that comes and goes like the violent waves on the surface of an ocean. We cannot think of an ocean without waves. The waves are soft sometimes (happy mind). They may be violent sometimes (distressful). The non moving stable unperturbed water is not visible on the surface. We tend to conclude ‘an ocean is made of only the waves’. Life appears to be made only of these waves of happy or unhappy moments. But what one needs to realize is that it is all water. The waves on the surface and the non moving deep waters underneath are both made of the same stuff, the water. The entire stuff of our existence is the quiet non moving blissful awareness that forms the background or the screen on which all experiences happen. Thus blissful awareness whether you have realized it or not is the basic swa- stha state or the healthy state of being.</span><br/><span>Look at every child. They are naturally blissful. They don’t need any thing to be happy. Only thing that happens with them is that they some times go away from the happiness and there is a reason for that. Those situations which bring them away from their nature called happiness are only the hunger, thirst and sleep. Some children are very conservative. They come away from their very nature only in the last second. Until that time they are happily playing and when the situation occurs that they can not stay any longer without food then suddenly they start crying. Mothers tell the children “wait my baby, don’t cry. Why don’t you give me two minutes so that I can fix your food?” But if there was one more minute’s time the child would have been blissfully playing! The same way the child gets irritated when they feel sleepy and they fall off to sleep within a minute .They are playing until the last second of their wakeful state. Once they get up again they are blissful. Thus the baby comes away from happiness when the basic needs bother the original nature. As adults these basic needs of drinking and eating are no longer guided by thirst or hunger but we have made it a habit to go on and on with eating and drinking incessantly. We need to have a bed coffee and then a small breakfast, followed by another coffee and then a small munch and another small coffee etc. This story of repeated coffee and munching goes on and on. Especially on a holiday when you are not doing any thing then the requirement goes on multiplying.</span><br/><span>When we grow to become adults, it is not only the physical needs of thirst; hunger and sleep that take us away from our natural state of bliss but the wants are at subtler levels of our personality, the mind. Our needs are now completely at the level of intellect and emotions that takes us away from our natural state. Hunger, thirst and sleep no longer give us an alarm because all other things at a subtle level have silently taken over. These keep us so much preoccupied that we get lost in the ocean that is full of waves and waves alone and forget to see the bed of non-moving layer of water. The events of life that result in multitude of reactions including distress, agitation, depression, fear, excitement etc occupy all our wakeful hours. We wake up with problems and sleep with problems. We wake up into violent waves of activity and keep our mind and body active until the last second before we go off to sleep. Thus what was a natural state of happy blissful swastha state as a baby now became a state preoccupied with worries and unfulfilled desires. We have forgotten our basic blissful true nature .But remember you have not lost every thing. You have not lost anything, although you feel that you are always miserable and unhappy. The fact is that this state of bliss, whether we recognize it or not is still the background screen on which all this drama of unhappy violent waves can exist. The unchanging vast blissful existence and consciousness is always the base like the water under the waves. It is the background blissful awareness that is reporting to you that you are happy or unhappy. It provides the base on which we experience suffering or joy. Thus the agitations and waves are visible on the surface at different levels of our personality as shown in the table below. The remedy is to enter into the background by recognizing the freedom that is inbuilt into our system by using techniques to get back to our natural state. These are at different personality levels namely annamaya pranamaya manomaya and vijnanamaya and anandamaya kosas. The details are given in the table below.</span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Sd71EdtXnRI/AAAAAAAAAuY/H1x95zuK-kM/s1600-h/1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5322961266641706258\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Sd71EdtXnRI/AAAAAAAAAuY/H1x95zuK-kM/s200/1.jpg\"/></a><br/><br/></p>\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>\n<div>Note: Yoga practices take us back to our nature consciously!<br/>In the modern life style, stress related problems are on the increase. Medical professionals are talking about mind body medicine indicating the need to deal with these diseases at a psychological level. Yoga texts said that all unhappiness and bondage including physical illnesses are traceable to an imbalance that starts at the mind level (Mana eve manushyanaam karanam badha mokshayoh). They also gave a model to explain how these diseases that begin in the mind level percolate into the physical system through these kosas. They also went on to describe how practice of these techniques can take us to our original nature and help in prevention of many of these diseases. When the sage is saying ‘niramayah’ he means ‘may every one live in harmony and balance of all these kosas so that one can prevent and /or cure diseases’.<br/>I have an earnest appeal to you all. Please do not allow doctors to pump in medicines and carry out surgeries for diseases that are born out of mismanagement of your life style. Learn to recognize the root cause of the problem within yourself, do yoga practices that are therapeutically designed so that you can remove the root cause of the problem. Surgeries and medicines do have a role for immediate relief and taking care of injuries, infections etc.<br/>Since deep inside our true nature is this blissful awareness which is the basis of spirituality we need to nurture the spiritual attitude consciously as much as possible. This requires constant awareness and regular practice.<br/>May all see things good and auspicious!</div>\n<div><br/><strong>Next sentence of the sloka is sarve bhadrani pasyantu…</strong><br/><br/>This requires again our own awareness. There is so much comfort in looking at every thing as auspicious and good. Several people are of the opinion that if we do not look at the defects, then we can not improve ourselves or help others. This is not true. Appreciating the goodness in others does not disturb growth. On the other hand the growth that takes place by a positive feeling is the real spiritual way of growth. In fact if you appreciate the work done, your employee will put his heart and soul to function better each time. Seeing the good and treating every one as a manifestation of divinity helps you to develop a positive attitude towards life and be happy under all circumstances. This also helps the people around you to unfold their innate ability to keep growing continuously.</div>\n<div><br/><strong>Let there be no sorrow.</strong><br/>And finally the sage says ‘Makaschit duhka bhagbhavet!’What a universal prayer. He has no enmity towards any one in the entire creation. This is the true wish of a great master who has seen the unity of existence. By saying this prayer the sage is leading us through the real spiritual journey which will lead us to the realization that our nature is bliss. Life is full of events. Some events lead to happiness and some are unfortunate and can make us miserable. Here the sage is giving us this spiritual lesson that even these difficult moments of life triggered by unfortunate events need not make us miserable. He is hinting that you have the inner freedom to accept them without any complaint.</div>\n<div><br/>Once again let us recollect that a prayer is complimentary to hard work .It is not some thing some one can give us with out putting our effort. It is also not some thing which can reject the unseen higher force behind any activity. Prayer is to give additional inner strength that can give us confidence to work with full energy. When we pray, you are tuning yourself to the un-manifest good forces in the web of universal consciousness that can help you to get the desired results. It tunes you to the natural laws. Many a times when your prayer was very deep and heartfelt it worked wonders, is it not? The results were so rewarding, you got more than what you expected. You wonder and say ‘Oh God, thank you so much. Your grace is so great. Things are too good. ‘I’ could never have planned it this way, Thank you my Lord!!.<br/>Let us remember that all this process of spiritual satsang is useful and meaningful only if we recognize that ‘peace within is the basis of establishing peace in the entire globe here and now!’</div>","html":"<p><span>Sarve bhavantu sukhinah= may every one be happy</span><br/><span>Sarve santu niramayah= may every one be free from all diseases</span><br/><span>Sarve bhadrani pashyantu = may every one see goodness and auspiciousness in every thing</span><br/><span>Ma kaschit duhkha bhaag bhaveet- may none be unhappy or distressed</span><br/><span>Om shantih, shantih, shantih-Om peace, peace, peace!</span><br/><span>May all be happy, may all be free from sickness, may all see things good, and may none have misery. Om peace, peace, peace!</span><br/><br/><span>This is a very simple prayer applicable to one and all. Millions and millions of Indians have been offering this prayer for last five thousand and odd years. The prayer is so simple that one can easily remember the simple meaning as ‘ may all be happy and healthy’. As we go into the depth of its meaning there is lot more to understand about the psyche of the sages who offered this universal prayer which is wholesome, all encompassing, purely socialistic and highly spiritual. It brings out the uniqueness of a spiritual master who develops enormous love for the entire creation so that he not only does whatever best he can do for others and also offers prayer to the higher forces that are beyond one’s control .Thus, this prayer is not just a simple prayer but becomes a mantra, a goal for a sadhaka (spiritual seeker) to meditate upon and move on in the path of spiritually to achieve universality. Let us dwell on these thoughts in. Today’s satsang .</span><br/><br/><strong>Why do we need to pray?<br/></strong><span>Before I go on to explain the meaning of the mantra, let me give you an example from Mahabharata to show how the great warrior Bhishma was a living example (now there is enough proof through archeological studies that mahabharata is a history and not just an imagination of a poet) of this Indian (Hindu) advise that ‘we only have the right to pray for others and never for seeking favours for ourselves’. This is brought out beautifully by the poet through Bhishma’s own statement in the warfare.</span><br/><span>When every one had assembled for war at Kurukshetra, Krishna and Arjuna stood in the battle field discussing about the vital questions of life which turned out to be Bhagavad-Gita, the divine hymn, an all time message for humanity at large. Although the conches were already blown with full readiness for the orders from the leaders , the entire army had to wait and could not start off the war as Bhishma the senior of the two captains did not give the orders. The restless Duryodhana asks Bhishma ‘what is happening there? What are they discussing in the middle of the battle field? Why don’t you give the orders to start off?” Bhishma in turn replies ‘My dear son, let us wait for a few moments to start the destruction. They must be discussing some thing important’. Duryodhana says with arrogance, “Oh, what else could it be, I know it! Arjuna must be terrified looking at our army and he must be discussing how to run away from the war field!’. Bhishma replies to Duryodhana, “Why do you want to show off you ignorance.” and adds, “in all my life, I have never prayed for any favour for myself; whatever was given to me I accepted wholeheartedly. Only at this moment I feel like praying to wind God to blow towards me so that a few of those divine words of wisdom pouring out from Krishna’s lips may fall on my ears”. . This shows how great masters like Bhishma were living examples of this prayer that we only have the right to pray for others and not for self and it had percolated as a living culture of the Indian society. Thus, this prayer that carries such a great message has been sung and chanted heartily all over on this Indian soil over five thousand and odd years for the welfare of ALL.</span><br/><span>In the first place one may ask ‘what is the need for a spiritual master who has mastered all laws of nature, to pray to Gods (higher forces of creative intelligence), either for himself or for other? This is because the sage who has gone through this highest experience of oneness of the universal consciousness or self realization knows that praying is the mode and tool to manifest that experience and compassion for the fellow beings. In fact you will realize through your own experience that we cannot really change a person, unless he wants to, except to pray and pray for his or her well being which can fructify if done with full sincerity and integrity. You know that happiness is not something that you can get by possessions of material things. One may possess every thing one can think of that is meant to give happiness, but he may be the most miserable person. Money or position or power or authority can never ensure happiness. In fact, with a small introspective observation of the society and friends around you, you will realize that these two are not connected to each other at all. I am sure you have come across many people who do not have any luxurious possessions and do not have big laurels to their credit and live a very simple life, but they are very happy .You can see the pure genuine smile on their faces always. You also have examples of persons who have every luxury you ask for, but the happiness is not there. A person who is poor but unhappy, at least has a hope that one day he can find money and that he would become happy in future by satisfying his wants. But a person who has tons of money but is not happy is all the more miserable because he does not even have this hope that money can bring happiness. Similarly, the so called educated and knowledgeable person can be much more unhappy than an uneducated and ignorant person!. Upanishad goes on to unravel this truth systematically to reach the right understanding. These sages realized that real happiness is to ‘Know’ that ‘I’ am made of the stuff called ‘Ananda or happiness’ and also that ‘prayer’ is a wonderful tool to tap this divine happiness for one and all. Thus, having realized that satisfying the material wants of an individual cannot give the lasting happiness, what else can a sage who is established in this eternal happiness do as an expression of the great compassion that he nurtures for the fellow beings? How can he express his universal love? How can we the mortals who have not yet attained that highest experience of eternal happiness culture ourselves? Only thing any one can do is to pray that may every one be happy!</span><br/><span>Seeds contain the entire tree within them. Just this knowledge about its potentiality is of no use. You should allow it to express itself as the fully grown tree by preparing the soil and providing the necessary nourishment. If you do not prepare the ground and give the right type of environment the seed cannot sprout and yield a healthy and useful tree. In addition to this, once the sprouts have come up, it is also very important to deweed the wrong sprouts around. Prayer is like weeding out the wrong sprouts. It is important to carry on our duties with utmost care and efficiency and then the prayer works by deweeding the unseen obstacles. Rishis give these prayers with love, compassion and deep concern. But the prayers do not eliminate the need of our efforts to work with efficiency and commitment. Prayer is not for a lazy person.. Now, with this understanding let us try to understand the ideas in this prayer “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah…”</span><br/><br/><strong>‘May every one be happy…’</strong><br/><span>Every one here refers to the entire creation, to all sensuous beings including plants, animals and human beings. Although this prayer is in Sanskrit and though this is given in the so called Hindu scriptures, when the sages say “sarve…” they do not exclude non- Hindus. The prayer does not say, I pray God to give happiness to Hindus only and you do not deserve my prayers if you are not a Hindu!</span><br/><span>Some times the religious institutions can be so narrow that the God you believe in may be the same, the heaven and hell are the same, and the prophet also is the same, but you cannot pray for the well being of people of other sects. One of my Christian friends was saying that when she was a young girl in US, the church school she was going to, taught her that they are supposed to pray only for those who go to that particular church and those who are associated with other churches do not deserve their prayers. She realized the shallowness of this when she grew up, but for many of her friends this remained as a belief for life time! Religious fundamentalists in every religion have been responsible for creating such illogical unhealthy beliefs and even wars have been waged for protecting such doctrines. This is rampant even today when we are in this 21st century of science and technology, when man is considered to be dominated by logical thinking. Thus we see that our prayer shall reach every one , every human being, every one belonging to all religions, all castes, all creeds, all races, all animals and all plants not only on this planet but to all living beings on any planet in the galaxy. Then a question arises as to why we should pray for the protection and well being of bad people? Is it not important that we protect the good and destroy the bad? Does it not appear very logical that we pray only for protection of the good?</span><br/><br/><strong>No one is bad by birth</strong><br/><span>When the sage is saying ‘sarve…’ he is so large hearted that he includes not only the believers of God but those who do not believe in God. One may believe in god but he may be totally anti-social and inhuman, but on the other hand one may be a non=believer of God but very highly spiritual. Therefore the prayer does not exclude the non-believers of God!. This mantra says that we are supposed to pray for the well being of every one including the good and the bad, the lazy and the hard worker, a burglar and a savior or the downtrodden and the knowledgeable , Sarve…. therefore appears to be beyond all differentiations and denominations. How can the intellect accept this idea ‘May the good people be happy and the bad people also be happy!’ If good people are kept happy, they will continue to do good, but if the bad people are happy then they will continue to be bad. Only if they are unhappy or suffer then they have some chance of becoming good. This is the simple logic which appears to be the basis on which we have created courts and prisons to punish the bad and protect the good to maintain social peace.. This concept believes that if the criminals suffer tortures in the prison cell, then he will change into a good man. Hence the persons who manage the prison are trained to be cruel in their appearance and behaviour. I have never seen any prison myself but that is what is shown in the movies!</span><br/><span>Let us ask ourselves as to how many criminals have changed truly through these prisons and tortures? . We know that, a person who has been a criminal out side and who has never gone to a prison may have some fear about the life in the jail and the torture he has to face but once who has come back from the jail he will not even that fear any more. Not only that, once he is in jail he will have an opportunity to see several people who are more professional than himself and he would have had an opportunity to learn more tricks of committing crimes without getting caught. Out side they may to have had gurus to guide them, but once they are in side there are maha- gurus to guide them in many more tricks of the trade! Do you think cheating can not go on within the prison? One can pretend to be an obedient inmate, so that he can cleverly escape difficult jobs.</span><br/><span>This I have seen happening in many Ashrams, churches, organizations and amongst politicians too. In Ashramas , if you are close to the chief guru, you can be exempted from waking up early in the morning and sitting for meditation sessions like other inmates of the ashram!</span><br/><span>.Nadir Shah, the emperor was known to be some one who used to invent new types of tortures for the criminals every day. He thought that this may stop people from revolting against him. There is a story about him that once he asked his minister, ‘they say sleeping for long hours is bad for health according to scientists; is it true?’ The minister replied , “sir, the scientists’ findings are true in case of ordinary people but you are an exception .This does not apply to you, In your case the longer you sleep and lesser you are awake, the more healthy people will be!”</span><br/><br/><span>Thus, you can understand that, the fear of punishment may not change a person to become a good man and in fact it can make him worse. It is all hypothetical to say that punishment can change a bad person to become good. Of course it is necessary to punish the wicked and keep them away from the society so that they will not team up to destroy the entire society. But for individuals or groups to change we need a different approach. . These days revolutionary thinkers and reformers of prisons like Ms Kiran Bedi of Tihar jail or Mr Vyavahareji of Vivekananda Yoga research foundation, teachers of Sri Sri Ravishankar who teach the ‘art of living program’ etc have successfully introduced methods of vipassana meditation, and yoga in prisons with positive results of real change in these criminals . There are examples of a few of these criminals who have taken to teaching yoga and leading a respectable life in the society after they came out of the prison..</span><br/><span>Hence, this assumption that ‘bad people will become good through unhappiness’ does not seem to have a solid foundation. In addition, saying that good should be happy and bad should not be happy presupposes the idea that basically there are two different categories of people namely originally good and originally bad people. This also is not true by the simple logic that good people can turn bad and vice versa over time. How can we think that God creates originally good people and bad people! Why do you think that God would create some one bad? Is it by chance that some one is good? Is the creator partial to someone? How can we accept a universal creative intelligent being which is very partial to be ‘the God’?! Some religions posit other assumptions to explain this discrepancy that we see in the world. They say that God created good people and Satan created bad people! All these assumptions are so illogical that it cannot be the truth.</span><br/><span>According to the sages this prayer has a deep presupposition that by birth every one is good. If so, then why do we have bad people in the society? Why some people create problems to others? Why are there people like Hitler? </span><br/><span>God has not created any one originally bad or good. In their original nature every one has only goodness as his true nature. The real self, the “I”, the auspicious being, the changeless, the basic stuff of this universe made of Ananda is free from any taint of badness. Hence every one in their true nature is good and it is only the situations that make men behave badly. The difficult circumstances have forced them to become bad. In the given circumstances they found it so difficult to survive as good people and it pushed them to become bad as he had no other choice for survival. Even a bad guy, is only bad in his business hours and tries to be good wherever possible and expects others to be good to him. Even the worst of the criminal, a dacoit, wants his subordinates not to tell him a lie or be disloyal to him. Most of the Indian movies on any criminals show how caring he is for his mother, wife and children and can do anything to protect them.</span><br/><span>Intuitively, can you not feel this goodness in everyone? I do not think it requires any great spiritual master to tell you this .This is the reason that when you happen to get introduced to a new person for the first time ,you spontaneously greet him and say, “hello, nice to meet you or good to meet you!!”, even before you have known anything about the person. This is the wonderful expression of the positivity that you are able to see in the stranger about whom your mind has not yet formed any opinion&hellip; You never greet a person in a negative tone and not even in a neutral tone. It is spontaneously positive .You will never say, “ok, I am meeting you now, let me decide later on after some time whether it is nice to meet you or not!” At the outset you presume that he is good and only later when you find out that he has many unacceptable qualities you may change your opinion. Even then we need not say that the person is bad. You will only conclude that this person’s behaviour is not acceptable to ‘me’ and to the society at large.</span><br/><br/><strong>Seeing good in every one is the beginning of spiritual journey</strong><br/><span>You start a great spiritual journey when you nurture these spontaneous expressions that are inbuilt into our system and make it a Sadhana that you will consciously dwell on this thought that’ every one is good’. You don’t have to be defensive. The very thought that every one is good irrespective of gender, religion, colour or creed, brings out the feeling that every one belongs to me. You start recognizing that everyone is ‘my own ‘. And there is no need to be defensive about the people and society around you&hellip; This simply paves way to peaceful coexistence. It will add strength to your personality and makes you feel secure. When you think of goodness all the time, then all good aspects of your personality such as love and compassion, sharing and caring become visible and you get controlled by these good qualities&hellip; On the other hand when you become defensive you start looking at all the wonderful qualities in a person with suspicion. When we assume a positive attitude, the world becomes a heaven the same world appears to be a hell if you look at this with a negative attitude. Just because you want to look at things in positive attitude it does not mean that you could be careless and reckless. Chanakya says you lock the house not because the people around you are thieves but let your unlocked house not tempt people to become bad.. We don’t require to be policing the so called bad people all the time. On the other hand when you approach them with love, care and concern and pray for their well being, there are better chances that they change to become good people.</span><br/><span>Another question that you may ask is,’ if every one is good, then why do we have bad people around us? Why do we have criminals all over?’We have already answered this. To start with, a person was made good, but when he could not cope up with circumstances, he must have felt that he has exhausted all the fair means of overcoming the intense distress and was left with only one choice-either to take to wrong means or commit suicide. He did not know that he had yet another choice, a third option. He is stuck with the wrong notion that the cause of his unhappiness is the world around and the people around him. With this wrong notion, when he faces difficult situations and cannot come out as a successful happy person, he decides to take revenge on the society that caused the problem by torturing or disturbing or creating unhappiness to others. Generally this tends to show up as a torture for the innocent and the gentle ones in the society. Do you think he would have turned to be a bad person if he did not have to face such difficult situations? We said there is a third option that could have helped him to continue to be good. What is this? This is the notional correction; a cognitive correction; a correction at the level of perceiving the situation in an entirely opposite way; i.e. to recognize the inbuilt freedom to change your perception of the situation and correct the wrong notions about happiness and unhappiness itself. To understand this and find a permanent solution requires a small twist in the question. This shift in the question provides the answer. It removes the root of all distress and unhappiness. What is that shift? Ask yourself ‘what is unhappiness?’ instead of ‘what makes me unhappy?’ Or ask ‘what is happiness? Instead of asking “what makes me happy?”</span><br/><br/><strong>What is Happiness?</strong><br/><span>No prayer will give happiness. Nothing from out side can give you happiness. No out side situation can give us sorrow too. If out side can give us happiness the same out side can take away our happiness too. No outside agency has the authority on you more than you have. Out side can only create good or bad situations, but whether the situation makes you happy or unhappy is in your hands. The sage is one who has realized that he is the master. His prayers are therefore his wishes. He wants every one to realize this truth. He is not going to more happy or less happy by this prayer. It is his heart’s wish and enormous love for the creation that pours out in this form. Then it becomes a mantra.</span><br/><br/><strong>Unhappiness is a learnt habit</strong><br/><span>Our wrong understanding has given us unhappiness. For example, we feel very unhappy when we do not win in any game or feel miserable when some one gets more points. Playing any game is actually is meant for recreation and at the end of the game winners are happy and losers are miserable. It is obvious that all can not win. We forget that playing a game was for recreation and as a part of the game we created teams and rules etc. If we are not caught up in success or failure then we can always be happy. I watched a tennis game wherein the loser was so happy and cheerful that the winner became confused and dazed and lost his happiness. The crowd in the gallery turned and cheered up the loser as they found it very strange! Thus the loser won the hearts of the spectators than the winner.</span><br/><br/><strong>Unhappiness is a learnt habit.</strong><br/><span>As parents, we have created higher value for unhappiness in the minds of our children. We create the feeling in the child even before he knows any thing about the world that we love him and care for him only if he is unhappy or at least he shows he is unhappy and he is suffering. Only when the child is suffering then the mother leaves every work to take care of the child. The child learns that if he is happy the mother has no time for him at all! Dad will talk only when he is sick! If the child falls but is not hurt then the parents brush it aside. But if he cries for the hurt, then the parents are with him all the time. This way, unconsciously we are giving the message to the child that if you have to be important then you have to be sick and suffering. When he comes back from the school happily and shows no strain then he is not paid attention. On the other hand if the child shows he is tired and exhausted then he receives a lot of care. This message is used after he grows up also. The husband working in a government department comes back home tired and exhausted whether he works or not. These days in government offices who does any work? Every work in every country is out sourced! Then wife will come to him to take off his shoes and she serves him fresh coffee. Thing come to him&hellip; He has all sympathies. If the same person comes back home normal and not tired then he will only hear an instructions about where the milk is, where the sugar is etc and he has to fix his own coffee. Same thing happens to the wife too. She has also understood the trick of the trade. Child may have behaved very fine through out the day. But when the husband returns home, she has to show that she is exhausted taking care of the child whole day so that she deserves his sympathies! I therefore tell people that I and my wife have equally shared the burden of work and responsibilities this way. “She is busy and I look busy”!</span><br/><span>Another peculiar concept is ingrained in our minds right from our childhood. If one is happy for some time then he has to face unhappiness immediately after that. We are all the time</span><br/><span>living in the fear of unhappiness when we see a child happy and joyfully playing; we say ‘oh, now child is laughing so much that certainly it is going to cry soon’. If a child drops some thing on the floor and the thing breaks then it gets scolding but if the child breaks it and also cries, it gets sympathetic remarks from the parents! When we have given so much value for suffering, how can we expect that one can be happy always under all circumstances? Everywhere suffering has gained an upper hand and therefore it is hard to believe that every one should be happy and could be happy always.</span><br/><span>There is a difficulty in the education we give to the child. On one side we expect the child to get all top marks and top ranking in every thing he takes up. Even if he gets the second position, every one around him starts questioning why he did not get the first position? The child hears this so frequently that he feels his life is useless because he did not stand first. We forget that in every class only one person can be the first one and the rest are losers and every loss can make one miserable.</span><br/><span>Even the so called spiritual practices have also given too much importance to suffering. If you torture others, law is there to punish you but if you torture yourself then the society respects you as great spiritual person. When we portray the lives of great spiritual masters also, we tend to emphasize the torture they have undergone in their Sadhana. Talking about Buddha, I heard someone saying how much torture it was that he was not even getting enough food to eat and he had to go through so much humiliation etc. I am sure Buddha never felt that it was a torture or distress to go for alms. His only goal was to find what is there after death and this was so intense that nothing could disturb him. Buddha’s focus was some thing different and the emphasis given by the onlookers about his Sadhana was different. About Ramakrishna and Sharada Devi also people take so much joy in portraying as if it was a life of torture. If you torture others you will be prosecuted whereas if you torture yourself you will be decorated. What we need to learn from the life of these saints is that, being happy or unhappy does not depend on the circumstances and what appears to be torturous need not make you unhappy. If one wants to be unhappy and tortures himself then no one can help him and he will continue to be unhappy. Hence it is not the circumstance that is making us unhappy but it is the learnt habit of responding to the situation that has made us suffer and be unhappy. Thus, Sarve bhavantu sukhinah is essentially said to remove the wrong notion that suffering is valuable.</span><br/><br/><span>Does this mean that a spiritual seeker should not be looking for comfort? Even the notion that comfort will give me happiness is as wrong as suffering takes you close to spirituality. Material can not give any thing. Simplifying life is the essence of spirituality and not to subject to self torture! Dukha or suffering can not give us spirituality; therefore let us aspire for every one to be happy through this prayer Sarvebhavantu sukhinah.</span><br/><span>Let me sum up the ideas about happiness. Let us not have a wrong value for unhappiness and let us also not be confused that happiness can be achieved from out side or given by some one else. The sage realized that happiness is his true nature and he has a compassionate appeal and prays ’may everyone realize this truth’ that ‘happiness is my true eternal unchanging nature’.</span><br/><br/><strong>Freedom from sickness</strong><br/><span>Next sentence in the prayer is Sarve Santu Niramayah meaning ‘May every one be free from sicknesses.</span><br/><span>In Sanskrit we have a very interesting word for health. It is Swastha or Swaasthya, which means ‘to stay in oneself’ or ‘being oneself’. It implies that when you are Swastha, you are in total harmony with yourself which means that you have realized your original nature that ‘you are made of the stuff called happiness’. Thus, if health can be defined as being in oneself, then it is obvious that sickness or unhappiness is, being away from oneself. Thus our original nature is to be blissful and unhappiness is something that comes and goes like the violent waves on the surface of an ocean. We cannot think of an ocean without waves. The waves are soft sometimes (happy mind). They may be violent sometimes (distressful). The non moving stable unperturbed water is not visible on the surface. We tend to conclude ‘an ocean is made of only the waves’. Life appears to be made only of these waves of happy or unhappy moments. But what one needs to realize is that it is all water. The waves on the surface and the non moving deep waters underneath are both made of the same stuff, the water. The entire stuff of our existence is the quiet non moving blissful awareness that forms the background or the screen on which all experiences happen. Thus blissful awareness whether you have realized it or not is the basic swa- stha state or the healthy state of being.</span><br/><span>Look at every child. They are naturally blissful. They don’t need any thing to be happy. Only thing that happens with them is that they some times go away from the happiness and there is a reason for that. Those situations which bring them away from their nature called happiness are only the hunger, thirst and sleep. Some children are very conservative. They come away from their very nature only in the last second. Until that time they are happily playing and when the situation occurs that they can not stay any longer without food then suddenly they start crying. Mothers tell the children “wait my baby, don’t cry. Why don’t you give me two minutes so that I can fix your food?” But if there was one more minute’s time the child would have been blissfully playing! The same way the child gets irritated when they feel sleepy and they fall off to sleep within a minute .They are playing until the last second of their wakeful state. Once they get up again they are blissful. Thus the baby comes away from happiness when the basic needs bother the original nature. As adults these basic needs of drinking and eating are no longer guided by thirst or hunger but we have made it a habit to go on and on with eating and drinking incessantly. We need to have a bed coffee and then a small breakfast, followed by another coffee and then a small munch and another small coffee etc. This story of repeated coffee and munching goes on and on. Especially on a holiday when you are not doing any thing then the requirement goes on multiplying.</span><br/><span>When we grow to become adults, it is not only the physical needs of thirst; hunger and sleep that take us away from our natural state of bliss but the wants are at subtler levels of our personality, the mind. Our needs are now completely at the level of intellect and emotions that takes us away from our natural state. Hunger, thirst and sleep no longer give us an alarm because all other things at a subtle level have silently taken over. These keep us so much preoccupied that we get lost in the ocean that is full of waves and waves alone and forget to see the bed of non-moving layer of water. The events of life that result in multitude of reactions including distress, agitation, depression, fear, excitement etc occupy all our wakeful hours. We wake up with problems and sleep with problems. We wake up into violent waves of activity and keep our mind and body active until the last second before we go off to sleep. Thus what was a natural state of happy blissful swastha state as a baby now became a state preoccupied with worries and unfulfilled desires. We have forgotten our basic blissful true nature .But remember you have not lost every thing. You have not lost anything, although you feel that you are always miserable and unhappy. The fact is that this state of bliss, whether we recognize it or not is still the background screen on which all this drama of unhappy violent waves can exist. The unchanging vast blissful existence and consciousness is always the base like the water under the waves. It is the background blissful awareness that is reporting to you that you are happy or unhappy. It provides the base on which we experience suffering or joy. Thus the agitations and waves are visible on the surface at different levels of our personality as shown in the table below. The remedy is to enter into the background by recognizing the freedom that is inbuilt into our system by using techniques to get back to our natural state. These are at different personality levels namely annamaya pranamaya manomaya and vijnanamaya and anandamaya kosas. The details are given in the table below.</span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Sd71EdtXnRI/AAAAAAAAAuY/H1x95zuK-kM/s1600-h/1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5322961266641706258\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Sd71EdtXnRI/AAAAAAAAAuY/H1x95zuK-kM/s200/1.jpg\"/></a><br/><br/></p>  \n\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>\n\n<div></div>  \n\n<div>Note: Yoga practices take us back to our nature consciously!<br/>In the modern life style, stress related problems are on the increase. Medical professionals are talking about mind body medicine indicating the need to deal with these diseases at a psychological level. Yoga texts said that all unhappiness and bondage including physical illnesses are traceable to an imbalance that starts at the mind level (Mana eve manushyanaam karanam badha mokshayoh). They also gave a model to explain how these diseases that begin in the mind level percolate into the physical system through these kosas. They also went on to describe how practice of these techniques can take us to our original nature and help in prevention of many of these diseases. When the sage is saying ‘niramayah’ he means ‘may every one live in harmony and balance of all these kosas so that one can prevent and /or cure diseases’.<br/>I have an earnest appeal to you all. Please do not allow doctors to pump in medicines and carry out surgeries for diseases that are born out of mismanagement of your life style. Learn to recognize the root cause of the problem within yourself, do yoga practices that are therapeutically designed so that you can remove the root cause of the problem. Surgeries and medicines do have a role for immediate relief and taking care of injuries, infections etc.<br/>Since deep inside our true nature is this blissful awareness which is the basis of spirituality we need to nurture the spiritual attitude consciously as much as possible. This requires constant awareness and regular practice.<br/>May all see things good and auspicious!</div>  \n\n<div><br/><strong>Next sentence of the sloka is sarve bhadrani pasyantu…</strong><br/><br/>This requires again our own awareness. There is so much comfort in looking at every thing as auspicious and good. Several people are of the opinion that if we do not look at the defects, then we can not improve ourselves or help others. This is not true. Appreciating the goodness in others does not disturb growth. On the other hand the growth that takes place by a positive feeling is the real spiritual way of growth. In fact if you appreciate the work done, your employee will put his heart and soul to function better each time. Seeing the good and treating every one as a manifestation of divinity helps you to develop a positive attitude towards life and be happy under all circumstances. This also helps the people around you to unfold their innate ability to keep growing continuously.</div>  \n\n<div><br/><strong>Let there be no sorrow.</strong><br/>And finally the sage says ‘Makaschit duhka bhagbhavet!’What a universal prayer. He has no enmity towards any one in the entire creation. This is the true wish of a great master who has seen the unity of existence. By saying this prayer the sage is leading us through the real spiritual journey which will lead us to the realization that our nature is bliss. Life is full of events. Some events lead to happiness and some are unfortunate and can make us miserable. Here the sage is giving us this spiritual lesson that even these difficult moments of life triggered by unfortunate events need not make us miserable. He is hinting that you have the inner freedom to accept them without any complaint.</div>  \n\n<div><br/>Once again let us recollect that a prayer is complimentary to hard work .It is not some thing some one can give us with out putting our effort. It is also not some thing which can reject the unseen higher force behind any activity. Prayer is to give additional inner strength that can give us confidence to work with full energy. When we pray, you are tuning yourself to the un-manifest good forces in the web of universal consciousness that can help you to get the desired results. It tunes you to the natural laws. Many a times when your prayer was very deep and heartfelt it worked wonders, is it not? The results were so rewarding, you got more than what you expected. You wonder and say ‘Oh God, thank you so much. Your grace is so great. Things are too good. ‘I’ could never have planned it this way, Thank you my Lord!!.<br/>Let us remember that all this process of spiritual satsang is useful and meaningful only if we recognize that ‘peace within is the basis of establishing peace in the entire globe here and now!’</div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-04-10T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":59,"uuid":"de53ec41-ad94-421d-847a-df7bc2b9d13b","title":"Ego According to Vedantha -3-","slug":"ego-according-to-vedantha-3","markdown":"<p align=\"center\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The concept of ego is neither ontological nor philosophical in my view. It is a practical instrument in our hands. When we consider any thing as an instrument, then it is neither good nor bad intrinsically. But unfortunately it is the most misunderstood and wrongly punished aspect of our being. Normally, in most spiritual circles ‘ego’ is looked down and is considered to be a big hurdle in the path of one’s spiritual journey. Several questions come up while accepting this concept. Let us try and find a logical understanding of this ‘ego’, so that we can utilize this highly simplified introspective knowledge for the healthy growth of the individual to live a happy life free from all distresses which is the goal of any spiritual seeker. Let us pause and think without any prejudice, if the ‘ego’ was only a big hurdle and, a poison why such a thing was created by God?? Like many things which are good in one area and dangerous in another area, my feeling has always been that ego also must have its good and bad aspects. It may be that we have interpreted it wrongly and overplayed its bad aspects and made it a big hurdle to one’s evolution. It is like the food which can be nourishing when taken in the right way, in the right place, in the right quantity and at the right time (in empty stomach) and can become a poison and destructive when the conditions are not right. It is not the fault of the food but the application is wrong. Similarly, according to Indian philosophy there are both the good and bad aspects of the ‘ego’, just like a sharp edged razor which can be used for killing some one brutally or saving someone through a life saving surgery. We discuss about ‘ego’ and think that only adults can understand and realize the impact of ego on one’s life as it is too philosophical. But an incident happened which surprised me to realize how even a simple child can also recognize this concept of’ ego’. A group of our friends were watching a documentary on yoga and its relevance to modern man in which there were several elite people who were being interviewed to give their ideas about yoga, yoga research and its application as a science etc.. The anchor person questioned one of the participants of the panel, about his opinion on yoga. He started talking about how much he is committed to scientific experimentation, how many papers in science he has published and how rigorously he is scientific in his temperament etc. Listening to this for about two minutes, a small girl of not more than eight years sitting next to me said very innocently, “Why is he talking about himself and not coming to the topic?” It was interesting to realize that , while an innocent young girl could understand what is ego and also that it is bad which the elite adult , the speaker, could not .What could be the reason ? There are several reasons. Let us understand how Indian scriptures understand this inner stuff called ‘ego’ and how it camouflages itself as we grow into adults.</span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Ego , the self, can have dual existence, (a) as a distinct entity (the observer mind) or (b) connected inseparably with all aspects of our personality ,the entire body mind consciousness complex. Ego exists not only in human beings but you can find it in entire creation. That means every thing in this manifested world has its own ‘being’ which distinguishes its ‘self’ from others. Hence it cannot be good or bad; it is only a self distinguishing quality of the organism. Animals have ego, plants have ego and even the matter has its ego. In case of physical matter, we may not use the word ‘ego’, but we call it as its innate property .Thus, ego of physical matter establishes its identity and individuality, manifests as its fixed property and is predictable. .For example water follows the law that under normal pressure and temperature, it becomes steam at one hundred degrees centigrade and turns into ice at zero degree temperature. It is the property of the water. This property inbuilt into its nature distinguishes it from other substances. This is what I call as the ego of nonliving physical world and all objects share their distinct ‘self’ or ‘ego’. Similarly plants also have their own individuality. For example, roots grow downwards into the soil in search of water. The genetic programming is to find water and not just a downward growth. Hence, if the roots happen to come across an obstacle of a huge rock on their way, they know how to negotiate themselves to reach the water. This clearly indicates the inbuilt intelligence that helps the plant to survive and is achieved through this programmed effort to strive to reach a goal. This ability and intention to pursue its goal is the ego of a plant. Thus, in case of living organisms the ego takes on the property of trying to protect its own existence in addition to its physical property .This can be established so clearly when we see small plants which start their small roots in small cracks in a wall. These little ones, as they continue to grow, send their roots into the wall in such a complex network that even the huge stone structure may give way over time although their aim was never to destroy the wall. This ‘ego’ makes the widespread roots of huge trees break open and lift off the heavily concreted road surfaces for their survival. This is the ego of living things that is characterized by the law of ‘survival instinct’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Further in case of insects or animals, we can see this ego for survival or the survival instinct has an added advantage of mobility. Try to disturb an ant that is resting, you can see the ant becoming alert at once and trying to run away or fight for its survival. This survival instinct can be found even in the new born. </span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the’ Animal World Channel’ of the television i saw a live video, wherein the baby</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Turtles coming out of their eggs early in the morning on the sea shore, were swiftly rushing towards the ocean! They were millions of them and not one of them missed their direction. Who told them that the ocean is in that direction and they have to go to the ocean for their survival? Even though at some places the sand dunes were going up and the ocean was far behind them, the turtles made no mistake. The anchor of the program picked up one of them and turned it around and left it on the sand in the opposite direction, the turtle wasted no time to turn around and proceed on its journey to the ocean! It is the ego of the turtle which makes it to do this way. It is the individuality which ensures its survival. This I call as the ‘good ego’, the very nature of the individual described as ‘Asmita’ in Vedanta. This ‘Asmita’, the ego, is the first aspect of our personality to take birth as we evolve as an individual and then comes the other aspects of our being that includes the mind and the physical body.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As human beings also, we all have this ego that strives for survival. This exists from the time of birth. This is very much visible within seconds after birth even in human babes. I was watching a documentary where the doctor puts the baby on the mother’s tummy as soon as it is born (even with out cleaning it) and in less than ten minutes, it crawled on the mother’s tummy to reach the breast! How did the baby know that the food is available there! This is the ego of survival.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the case of human beings, apart from this survival ego which is programmed into our physiology, we have evolved enormous degree of free will which we may perceive as psychological ego. There are three aspects of this psychological ego that we use for our day to day functioning. These are- the doer ego, the identifier ego and the experiencer ego, which are called Kartrutva Asmita, Bhoktrutva Asmita and Jnatrutva Asmita respectively in Indian scriptures.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Let us try and understand what we mean by these three types of Asmita.</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">KARTRUTVA ASMITA</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">………………</span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Doer ego is responsible for carrying out the actions that we do and we need to do.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">For example we have legs and in order to keep the legs in good shape we need to walk. ‘I’ have to walk;’ I’ need to walk and this requires the ‘ego’ which is the good ego. If we do not have this ego we can not take care of our legs. We can not keep our body in a healthy state. Say you are convinced that doing yoga is good for your health and you have made a resolve that you shall do yoga regularly. If there is no strong ‘doer ego’, you can miss out on the regularity in spite of being convinced about its benefits. Thus a strong ‘doer ego’ is necessary under all circumstances so that we do not become parasites on the society. In order to promote this good doer ego, wise people said that if you do not take care of your ‘self’, you are a sinner. This concept of sin in this context was probably introduced to encourage us to recognize that if one does not put in the right amount of effort through a strong doer ego, he cannot be happy.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">A young man saw a caterpillar just turned into a butterfly and fighting to come out of its cocoon. With lot of sympathy for the struggling insect, he took a pair of scissors and very carefully cut the shell to release the butterfly out of its cocoon and was very happy about his success in helping a small creature.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Side by side, another butterfly also struggled and came out of its cocoon by itself.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Finally when both of them were out in the free world, the butterfly that did not fight or struggle could not fly because the wings had not grown fully. On the other hand, the one which had struggled through its life had strong wings and flew freely. We realize that even a butterfly has to nurture a strong doer ego in order to grow fully! Same way we have to do what we need to do, in order to grow. This is the positive ‘doer ego’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">There are two ways in which one can utilize this Kartrutva. The doer ego can be called Asmita when we do the work with a sense of duty which is the good Kartrutva ego. The same Kartrutva becomes Ahankara or ‘bad Kartrutva ego’ when we try to claim the ‘doership’. In the present day life style we see many stress related problems in high profile performers (executive stress) that can go on to many killer diseases such as hypertension and heart disease. The doer ego of such a workaholic person is very strong and effective that produces great results .But the problems of stress that goes with it is basically created by the ‘ahankara’, (‘I am the doer’) that goes with it and not the Asmita ego. The problem of such an activity is not created by the activity, but by the doer. Hence the solution does not lie in giving up the activity but changing the inner ‘doer ego’ through right understanding and introspectively change from Ahankara to Asmita. Of the several techniques that have been recommended for this, Sri Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita says ‘the fire called true knowledge of the self burns the action’ .Through the right knowledge, the Ahankara is removed resulting in complete freedom from the distresses of life including the so called executive stresses. How can knowledge burn an activity? Spiritual knowledge has especially no connection with activity. Knowledge has nothing to do with action directly. It is directly connected with ignorance. Knowledge has its role in removing the ignorance. Ignorance gives rise to Ahankara. What is this right knowledge of self? The right knowledge is to realize that it is really the universal intelligence that is doing the work using ‘me’, the doer ego, as an instrument .Ignorance of this knowledge obviously results in doership and Ahankara. With the dawn of the right knowledge that ‘ I am only an instrument in the hands of the divine universal will or the universal ego’, the Ahankara gets burnt. The moment the identification with this limited ‘I’, the Ahankara goes, the ‘doer’ falls and the attachment to the action also drops. Then the burden of ego is dissolved.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Here, the question that needs to be addressed is, how can such a person with no ‘doer ego’ function in this world after it has been completely burnt ? How can any one function efficiently without an intense commitment to the activity on hand? The answer comes from the following proclamation of the scriptures. After attaining this true spiritual knowledge, although the doer ego does not exist in its earlier form, its functional aspect continues to be available with all its capabilities. Hence the practically useful functional abilities that are necessary for survival and doing good to others etc., do not go away, but the snow balling effect of the repercussions of good and bad actions(called vasanas) are completely erased. The example for this is that of a burnt rope.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Krishna says that even after the action is burnt by the fire of knowledge, he continues to function with an ego with utmost efficiency. A burnt rope that is not disturbed has exactly the same appearance as before but cannot act any more like a rope. Another useful example of a burnt ego is that of a burnt seed which has the same size, shape and appearance as a live seed but it has lost its potential to sprout any more. This seed does not give rise to any branches and reproduce more seeds. Same way a burnt action cannot gather unconscious impressions (vasanas) of suppressed emotions such as unfulfilled desires, hatred, anger, frustration etc. The activity goes on with a sense of duty and joy without any distress. Sri Ramakrishna says that the realized person goes on working like a wheel that continues to rotate and function with gathered momentum without collecting any mass on itself. It is like the way light removes the fear of darkness. Light literally has nothing to do with fear, but it was the non visibility of the obstacles in the room due to darkness that created the fear of a non-existent danger. And the moment he light is lit, things become clear and the fear drops off. If you were holding a gun to protect yourself from danger in the dark room, you drop that gun too. Light directly can not drop the gun but it appeared that light dropped the gun from your hand. Same way knowledge drops the identification of the doer. Once the doer is dissolved, the fever of activity also disappears.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The difference between an ordinary person’s Karma (the unconscious non erasable impressions created by any action )and the Karma of a Jnani is that, in the case of a Jnani, karmas are like lines drawn on the water and in case of an ordinary person the Karma is like line drawn on a stone. Even of you take a sharp instrument and draw a line on water the line will not last even for a second. On the other hand even if a soft substance like water falls on the stone repeatedly it can make lasting impressions as we see in river beds. This is to say that in case of a Jnani even if he does work of killing as a worrier he will not be affected but in case of an ordinary person who does the work with ahankara, even a respectable action of giving a charity, can lead to intense attachment and result in deep impressions (called punya vasana).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">We claim credits for things for which we are not really responsible and we become a Kartru for that action. For example, we say ‘I breathe’. We cannot take even a single breath by our own effort if the system fails. If the “I”, the ahankara type of (bad) ego had to decide to do the job of breathing, we would have been dead by now. Many things which we are supposed to do, we conveniently forget and this can be one of them because taking breath is such a monotonous activity and hence this has been programmed into our nature and is the Asmita type of doer ego. God has given us legs and we are supposed to walk. How many of us walk regularly? God has given us joints and wanted us to regularly exercise them but we don’t do it and land up with ailments like arthritis. That is why God kept the activity like breathing to go on by itself but we claim that ‘I breathe’! Similarly we say ‘I have given birth’ to my son. Giving birth to another human being is such a great act of creation that only God can do that and in this process he uses us as an instrument .We are only the birth canal and nothing more than that! But we do have the responsibility to take care of them to develop into a healthy human being. When we say ‘I gave birth to him or her’ it is Kartrutva Ahankara which is bad, but when we take the responsibility of bringing up our children that is Kartrutva Asmita which is good.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When Buddha came back from his tapas of several years, his father said to him ‘I gave birth to you!’ Buddha replied, “Oh Father, when you were not born ‘I’ was there. I am coming from the time when this universe was created and you are also coming from the time of creation. We are meeting here in this life like two passengers meeting in a train. We both only happen to meet here as father and son!”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another form of Kartrutva Ahankara is found in organizations. There are many responsible members in the structure of an organization to run it efficiently. Some times, some people want to take on every thing on their own shoulders and are never satisfied with any one else’s way of functioning and they tend to suffocate the other functionaries. Here the intentions may be good but the ego of one person wanting to be the Ahankara Kartru is the sickness that prevents him from functioning with a peace of mind and getting the joy of performing! In addition it also comes in the way of the growth of the other persons in the organization. Here, the litmus test is whether the activity is done using Asmita or Ahankara type of ego. If one can nurture the capacity to move from Ahankara to Asmita, then it will help them to enjoy the work they are doing .This helps one to grow. But if the work is done with Ahankara Kartrutva then the person will not grow.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When I was working as an engineer, one of my colleagues- a senior executive, wrote a very unsatisfactory report about his junior and sent it to the administration asking them for extension of his probationary period and not to make him a permanent employee although he was his close friend at a personal level. But we all knew that the junior was very capable, intelligent, and hard working. The administration asked me to solve this problem! I observed their way of functioning in the office for ten days. I noticed that, whenever there was any work in the office, the senior would ask the junior to attend to it and within a few minutes he would go back and check whether the work has been completed. If it was not completed he would conclude that the junior is not confident to tackle the problem, immediately jump in and complete the work himself. Poor fellow, the junior employee had to stand there as a mere spectator with folded hands! Now, this senior executive has a valid point when he said ‘look at his way of doing. How can you expect me to give him a good report?’ I interfered and explained to him that he, as a senior is not allowing the junior to grow. I advised him,’ give him an opportunity, give him time, let him do mistakes and you please correct his mistakes and help him to grow’. The senior understood and gave him time to finish the work at his own pace. When the junior was given the freedom and opportunity, in less than three months, he came up so well that the same senior, not only sent a good report but also mentioned that this junior should be working under him only. This is a very subtle Kartrutva ego! This Kartrutva ego undermined the Kartrutva responsibility of training a junior. This can be seen happening in many organizations where very efficient seniors cannot create and recognize capable juniors to take over!. Thus the Karturtva ego is not always bad . One needs to grow from the doer ego to the responsible ego</span></span></span></p>\n\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">BHOKTRUTA</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">…………….</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The second type of ego is the ‘experiencer’ ego or the Bhoktrutva Asmita. We require this experiencer ego to perceive and experience the inputs from the world around us through our sense organs such as eyes, ears etc. Hence the experiencer ego is incorporated into the act of perception. For example, the eyes carry the experience of light and its diversities.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Seeing is an experience and we are continuously guided by this experience.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sense perception is a direct experience for which we don’t have to depend upon anybody else’s experience (This is called pratyaksha pramaana). We say, ‘I have seen with my own eyes’. I see through my eyes and not through your eyes. We see using my experiencer ego and not someone else’s experiencer ego.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">This ‘I’ who sees cannot be replaced by any amount of technological development. When I was a boy of ten years, I went to an ophthalmologist to get my eyes tested. At that time the sophisticated technology was not developed. The doctor put a frame on my eyes and mounted a lens and he asked me whether I see clearly. After a few trials, I said that ‘wow, this lens is the best as ‘I’ can see clearly with this’. Then the doctor gave me a prescription of that particular power of glasses. Recently I had an eye checkup in USA and this time it was they used the latest computerized technology. A gadget was mounted on my eyes and some computer signals were generated. But this time also the decision was made based on my inputs as to when I see it blurred or when I see it clearly. The experiencer is important for right perception happen and it can not be replaced how ever much the technology develops. This experiencer ego is a life saving mechanism. The experience brings about responses that can invite immediate self protective actions. Like the experience of pain or suffering, experience of a foreign and dangerous virus entering our system through the nasal passage or a wrong food put in the stomach etc.. This perception immediately sets the system into action and helps us to protect ourselves. If there is discomfort, immediately the child cries to indicate that it is experiencing some thing which is not agreeable with the system and the mother immediately responds. That is the experiencer ego which is present even before the intellect is born. Therefore, the experiencer Asmita does not belong to intellect. For example, when a wrong and unhealthy material enters through the air that we breathe, immediately the nasal passage responds by sneezing.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">This is the experiencer ego which is the good part of our ego. Every part of our body has its own experiencer ego which protects not only itself but has the ability to respond suitably to protect the whole body.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The experiencer ego is also responsible for our sensitivity. We have the capacity not only to experience our own pains and sufferings, but we do experience the pain, suffering and joy of others. Even the pet dog in your house is sensitive to your pleasures and pains, your anger and joy etc.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we have seen how important the experiencer ego is, for the sake of healthy survival. It also becomes a problem when it functions the ahankara way and not the Asmita way..</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sensitivity is a gift and a sign of evolution, but oversensitivity or wrong sensitivity can create problems. This oversensitivity can lead to unnecessary responses that can upset our emotional balance resulting in agitation, anxiety, depression etc. with the resultant health problems. For example, many do not have the sensitivity to be clean and neat .That is the reason the preparatory steps of ashtanga yoga prescribes shoucha or cleanliness (outside and inside) as one of the important steps to promote and maintain cleanliness and orderliness. This is one of the niyamas, the individual disciplines. But some times people can be so obsessed with cleanliness that their whole time is spent on cleaning and arranging things that they can do nothing beyond and their life revolves around that for ever. At that point they can only see dirt every where and that can turn into a disease called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) !</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Same way, our good Bhoktrutva ego aids in healthy perception of smell so that we can smell good fragrance to enjoy and smell bad things to protect our system. But if one becomes over sensitive, he not only perceives unwanted smells but can be so sick that his life becomes miserable. On close observation, we can see that this is not because of sensitivity of the sense organ that he is in trouble but he is suffering because of his attachment to the sensitivity. Therefore the experiencer is Asmita which is useful and the attachment to the experience is Ahankara which is suffering!</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> <br/></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">JNATRUTVA</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">……………….</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The third aspect is the identifier ego which is known as Jnatrutva Asmita. This identifier ego is very important and exists even in plants and animals. Because of this ego, a dog can recognize a dog, and not only as a dog but can distinguish a ‘she dog’ from a ‘he dog’. A he-dog not only recognizes a dog but he also recognizes whether the other one is she dog or he dog. If the other one is a she dog then he approaches it a wagging tail but the other dog happens to be a male then he is ready to fight or run away for life. This recognition is necessary for the sake of maintaining the species. This shows, though the dog does not know the word called dog, he knows that the other one belongs to his own species. This is its Jnatrutva ego. Similarly we also have identification ego, the Jnatrutva Asmita.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Even in human beings also, this Jnatrutva ego has the two dimensions of species and sex identity as seen in animals. The moment we see another human being we feel a form of comfort that we can not experience with animals or plants around us. We also have the ego that identifies ourselves as a man or a woman. This identification is so strong and deep that it will not leave us even in our dreams. In dreams also we belong to the same gender. This is the power of Jnatrutva Asmita. This identification is very important to maintain the social order and discipline.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the society, the Jnatrutva Asmita has other forms of identities. A father has father’s Asmita, mother has mother’s Asmita, a child has child Asmita, a citizen has his citizen Asmita etc. this identity or Asmita provides the necessary social bonds and fixes their roles in the social organization.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">For a family to survive healthy and happy, all these forms of Asmita are very important. In the Indian society particularly there are such strict adherences to family structure that they observe their roles with religious rigor. We have such stories from Ramayana.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama had identified so intensely with his role of protecting them that Seeta, the elder brother’s wife, became his mother for the entire period of their stay in the forest. His deep respect for her made him always look at her with head down. This aspect has been brought out poetically by the poet Valmiki. When Seeta was abducted and was being taken away by air in Pushpakavimana by air by the evil Ravana, very thoughtfully Seeta bundled some of her ornaments and dropped on a hill when she heard some voices so that this may guide Rama to find her. . The monkey army on the hill had found them and had preserved them. When ram reached that place in search of Seeta and Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys showed them to Rama ,he says ‘Oh, lakshmana ,The memories of Seeta by looking at these ornaments are filling my eyes with tears .I just cannot identify them . Can you please help me?’ Lakshmana examines them and indentifies only her toe rings and says, ‘My dear brother, I am sure these are her toe rings as I would see them daily when I bow down to her feet. In the morning’. He could not identify the necklaces or bangles as he never would raise his head in front of mother Seeta. </span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">That way, he sets an example for how a brother should respect his sister in law.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Just like we all have our roles (role ego or role Asmita) and responsibility for the health of the family, we also have a responsibility in the society too. In society a teacher has teacher’s Asmita and an executive has executive’s Asmita etc. Same way all the roles have their respective egos. If a person who is a teacher does not have that teacher’s ego he can not be an efficient teacher, like the way a father who does not have a father’s ego is not an efficient father. In an organization it is also necessary that we not only have to take care of our own Asmita but we also need to protect the organizational ego. For example if you are the chief of an organization and if you cannot uphold the ego of your juniors in the company in front of others, then not only the outsiders do not respect the organization but they loose their respect for you also.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The role ego is important. One has to have the core competency. Adi Shankaracharya in this context says that those who have this core competency are Adhikarinah. Therefore it has to be understood that the role ego is actually the responsibility of a person and is not for feeling egoistic about it. But unfortunately today when one assumes administrative positions, they become egotistic and tend to lose their responsibility. Especially when one gets into political positions it becomes a matter of Ahankara and not Asmita. It generally happens that people who occupy high positions end up as poor administrators because they are not competent to adhere to their Asmita ego to function with responsibility and end up becoming egoistic and self centered due to the Ahankara Bhoktrutva.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In Ramayana, when it was decided that Rama was to be enthroned as the prince, Sage Vasishtha says to Rama, ‘my dear Rama, this is a time for people of Ayodhya to celebrate as they are going to have a great prince, but for you, this is the time for contemplation as you are taking up the responsibility for the kingdom. Becoming a prince is to take up responsibility for the entire community by nurturing the king Asmita and give no room for the king Ahankara to capture your mind’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When Asmita ego is at work the person identifies with the position, only during the work because this ego belongs to the position and not to the person. But ordinary persons do not understand this. The ignorance of the Ahankara ego is to identify with the position inseparably. This identification results in making a teacher behave like a teacher even while he is not teaching. A doctor becomes a doctor even in the shopping place. He may be playing cards in a club, but he thinks that he is doctor there too. They don’t realize that it is a big burden to carry that title wherever they go. We tend to forget how to be a simple common human being. When he is giving medicine to a patient, identifying with the position of a doctor gives him the freedom and authority to function efficiently as a medical doctor. But in the market place, being a doctor takes away this freedom which a common man can enjoy. We tend to forget that we are a common man and want to ride over others. This is like an actor is doing a role where he becomes a murderer or a criminal but he is not so otherwise when he is not on the stage. In fact, if only he actor does the role like that then only he can do it much more effectively than when he gets lost and becomes the role that he is playing! Once the famous Indian scientist and highly respected person in early nineteenth century Eswarachandra Vidyasagar was watching a stage drama being played in Calcutta sitting in the front seat he was totally absorbed in the play. A person who was acting like a bad person was giving such a trouble to the young lady character. It was all in the drama but Eswara Chandra Vidyasagar felt it so real that out of total rage he got up and hurled his shoe at that actor. The person immediately caught the shoe and paid his respects to the professor saying, “Sir, I received many many mementos for my acting but to day what I received in the form of your shoe is the most precious one and I would like to preserve it for the life time. Please allow me not to return this shoe to you,”</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Only then Eswara Chandra Vidyasagar, realized what happened! An actor does much better wok than a person who forgets this and gets attached to what role he is playing.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Once the governor of Kyoto Mr. Kitagagi went to a Zen master and gave his visiting card to the young boy sitting at the front desk to be presented to the master. The moment the young boy saw the card , he was alerted, filled with fear, because such a great person had come to see the master, and responded saying “Sir, please wait here , I shall show this card to the master and come back to you to take you in”. The boy rushed in and presented the card to the master.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The master was busy in talking to some body and casually looked at the card and continued his dialogue. The boy became restless and tried to draw the attention of the master to the card. Master replied, “Wait! Let me finish my work on hand before I attend to the card”. After a while, he slowly looked at the card from top to bottom and with a harsh tone said, “Why is this man here? Ask him to get out immediately!” The boy was surprised at the harshness in the tone of the master. The boy could not say any thing and hesitantly came back to Mr. Kitagagi who was eagerly waiting expecting the answer from the master to bring him in. But the boy said “sir, the master is busy.” Kitagagi said, ‘I can wait I am not in a hurry’. Now the boy was in trouble and and had to say, ‘Sir, may be he is not available today’ as he did not want to repeat the harsh words of the master to the governor. Looking at the discomfort of the boy the Governor asked him, “Tell me exactly what the master told you?”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The boy narrated every word that the master had said very apologetically. The governor went in to deep thinking for a moment. Suddenly he took the card and scratched the word ‘governor of Kyoto’ and asked the boy to produce it to the master. The boy did not feel comfortable. But very reluctantly he went in and showed the card. The moment the Zen master saw the card, with a great joy he told the boy ‘why is he sitting out side? Please bring him in”. In fact, the master got up from his seat, walked towards the door and said ‘Kitagagi, please come in’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In this anecdote, one can see that the governor is necessary for a state. But he was carrying this burden of a governor even when he came to the Zen master.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">A seeker of truth has to drop all burdens. We tend to carry the burden and suffer because of inseparable identification of our ego with the position we hold.If this identifier ego can identify only at the time of being in that position, then it is Asmita and if the Jnatrutva ego becomes identified inseparably all the time and carries the burden around, then it becomes Ahankara type of Jnatrutva ego.</span></span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we find the clear distinction between good ego(Asmita) and bad ego(Ahankara) ,in all three aspects of our being, i.e. the doer ego(Kartrutva), the experiencer ego( Bhokrutva) and identifier ego( Jnatrutva).This clear and useful distinction portrayed in Vedantic scriptures should help a sincere seeker to culture Asmita and get out of the bondage of Ahankara which is the ignorance that is repeatedly recognized as a hindrance to one’s spiritual growth . Let me summarize this in the following way.</span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><a id=\"0.1_table01\" name=\"0.1_table01\"></a></span></span></p>\n<div align=\"left\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Aspect</span></span></span></span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Asmitha or good ego</span></span></span></span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Ahamkara or bad ego</span></span></span></span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></span></span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Kartrutva or doer ego</span></span></span></span><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Need for doing like exercising, learning etc</span></span></span></span>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Allowing others to grow and develop taking the team in collective way</span></span></span></span></p>\n<span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">1.Instead of doing a work as responsibility but taking pride of it</span></span></span></span>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">2.

It is a practical instrument in our hands. When we consider any thing as an instrument, then it is neither good nor bad intrinsically. But unfortunately it is the most misunderstood and wrongly punished aspect of our being. Normally, in most spiritual circles ‘ego’ is looked down and is considered to be a big hurdle in the path of one’s spiritual journey. Several questions come up while accepting this concept. Let us try and find a logical understanding of this ‘ego’, so that we can utilize this highly simplified introspective knowledge for the healthy growth of the individual to live a happy life free from all distresses which is the goal of any spiritual seeker. Let us pause and think without any prejudice, if the ‘ego’ was only a big hurdle and, a poison why such a thing was created by God?? Like many things which are good in one area and dangerous in another area, my feeling has always been that ego also must have its good and bad aspects. It may be that we have interpreted it wrongly and overplayed its bad aspects and made it a big hurdle to one’s evolution. It is like the food which can be nourishing when taken in the right way, in the right place, in the right quantity and at the right time (in empty stomach) and can become a poison and destructive when the conditions are not right. It is not the fault of the food but the application is wrong. Similarly, according to Indian philosophy there are both the good and bad aspects of the ‘ego’, just like a sharp edged razor which can be used for killing some one brutally or saving someone through a life saving surgery. We discuss about ‘ego’ and think that only adults can understand and realize the impact of ego on one’s life as it is too philosophical. But an incident happened which surprised me to realize how even a simple child can also recognize this concept of’ ego’. A group of our friends were watching a documentary on yoga and its relevance to modern man in which there were several elite people who were being interviewed to give their ideas about yoga, yoga research and its application as a science etc.. The anchor person questioned one of the participants of the panel, about his opinion on yoga. He started talking about how much he is committed to scientific experimentation, how many papers in science he has published and how rigorously he is scientific in his temperament etc. Listening to this for about two minutes, a small girl of not more than eight years sitting next to me said very innocently, “Why is he talking about himself and not coming to the topic?” It was interesting to realize that , while an innocent young girl could understand what is ego and also that it is bad which the elite adult , the speaker, could not .What could be the reason ? There are several reasons. Let us understand how Indian scriptures understand this inner stuff called ‘ego’ and how it camouflages itself as we grow into adults.</span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Ego , the self, can have dual existence, (a) as a distinct entity (the observer mind) or (b) connected inseparably with all aspects of our personality ,the entire body mind consciousness complex. Ego exists not only in human beings but you can find it in entire creation. That means every thing in this manifested world has its own ‘being’ which distinguishes its ‘self’ from others. Hence it cannot be good or bad; it is only a self distinguishing quality of the organism. Animals have ego, plants have ego and even the matter has its ego. In case of physical matter, we may not use the word ‘ego’, but we call it as its innate property .Thus, ego of physical matter establishes its identity and individuality, manifests as its fixed property and is predictable. .For example water follows the law that under normal pressure and temperature, it becomes steam at one hundred degrees centigrade and turns into ice at zero degree temperature. It is the property of the water. This property inbuilt into its nature distinguishes it from other substances. This is what I call as the ego of nonliving physical world and all objects share their distinct ‘self’ or ‘ego’. Similarly plants also have their own individuality. For example, roots grow downwards into the soil in search of water. The genetic programming is to find water and not just a downward growth. Hence, if the roots happen to come across an obstacle of a huge rock on their way, they know how to negotiate themselves to reach the water. This clearly indicates the inbuilt intelligence that helps the plant to survive and is achieved through this programmed effort to strive to reach a goal. This ability and intention to pursue its goal is the ego of a plant. Thus, in case of living organisms the ego takes on the property of trying to protect its own existence in addition to its physical property .This can be established so clearly when we see small plants which start their small roots in small cracks in a wall. These little ones, as they continue to grow, send their roots into the wall in such a complex network that even the huge stone structure may give way over time although their aim was never to destroy the wall. This ‘ego’ makes the widespread roots of huge trees break open and lift off the heavily concreted road surfaces for their survival. This is the ego of living things that is characterized by the law of ‘survival instinct’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Further in case of insects or animals, we can see this ego for survival or the survival instinct has an added advantage of mobility. Try to disturb an ant that is resting, you can see the ant becoming alert at once and trying to run away or fight for its survival. This survival instinct can be found even in the new born. </span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the’ Animal World Channel’ of the television i saw a live video, wherein the baby</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Turtles coming out of their eggs early in the morning on the sea shore, were swiftly rushing towards the ocean! They were millions of them and not one of them missed their direction. Who told them that the ocean is in that direction and they have to go to the ocean for their survival? Even though at some places the sand dunes were going up and the ocean was far behind them, the turtles made no mistake. The anchor of the program picked up one of them and turned it around and left it on the sand in the opposite direction, the turtle wasted no time to turn around and proceed on its journey to the ocean! It is the ego of the turtle which makes it to do this way. It is the individuality which ensures its survival. This I call as the ‘good ego’, the very nature of the individual described as ‘Asmita’ in Vedanta. This ‘Asmita’, the ego, is the first aspect of our personality to take birth as we evolve as an individual and then comes the other aspects of our being that includes the mind and the physical body.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">As human beings also, we all have this ego that strives for survival. This exists from the time of birth. This is very much visible within seconds after birth even in human babes. I was watching a documentary where the doctor puts the baby on the mother’s tummy as soon as it is born (even with out cleaning it) and in less than ten minutes, it crawled on the mother’s tummy to reach the breast! How did the baby know that the food is available there! This is the ego of survival.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the case of human beings, apart from this survival ego which is programmed into our physiology, we have evolved enormous degree of free will which we may perceive as psychological ego. There are three aspects of this psychological ego that we use for our day to day functioning. These are- the doer ego, the identifier ego and the experiencer ego, which are called Kartrutva Asmita, Bhoktrutva Asmita and Jnatrutva Asmita respectively in Indian scriptures.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Let us try and understand what we mean by these three types of Asmita.</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">KARTRUTVA ASMITA</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">………………</span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Doer ego is responsible for carrying out the actions that we do and we need to do.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">For example we have legs and in order to keep the legs in good shape we need to walk. ‘I’ have to walk;’ I’ need to walk and this requires the ‘ego’ which is the good ego. If we do not have this ego we can not take care of our legs. We can not keep our body in a healthy state. Say you are convinced that doing yoga is good for your health and you have made a resolve that you shall do yoga regularly. If there is no strong ‘doer ego’, you can miss out on the regularity in spite of being convinced about its benefits. Thus a strong ‘doer ego’ is necessary under all circumstances so that we do not become parasites on the society. In order to promote this good doer ego, wise people said that if you do not take care of your ‘self’, you are a sinner. This concept of sin in this context was probably introduced to encourage us to recognize that if one does not put in the right amount of effort through a strong doer ego, he cannot be happy.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">A young man saw a caterpillar just turned into a butterfly and fighting to come out of its cocoon. With lot of sympathy for the struggling insect, he took a pair of scissors and very carefully cut the shell to release the butterfly out of its cocoon and was very happy about his success in helping a small creature.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Side by side, another butterfly also struggled and came out of its cocoon by itself.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Finally when both of them were out in the free world, the butterfly that did not fight or struggle could not fly because the wings had not grown fully. On the other hand, the one which had struggled through its life had strong wings and flew freely. We realize that even a butterfly has to nurture a strong doer ego in order to grow fully! Same way we have to do what we need to do, in order to grow. This is the positive ‘doer ego’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">There are two ways in which one can utilize this Kartrutva. The doer ego can be called Asmita when we do the work with a sense of duty which is the good Kartrutva ego. The same Kartrutva becomes Ahankara or ‘bad Kartrutva ego’ when we try to claim the ‘doership’. In the present day life style we see many stress related problems in high profile performers (executive stress) that can go on to many killer diseases such as hypertension and heart disease. The doer ego of such a workaholic person is very strong and effective that produces great results .But the problems of stress that goes with it is basically created by the ‘ahankara’, (‘I am the doer’) that goes with it and not the Asmita ego. The problem of such an activity is not created by the activity, but by the doer. Hence the solution does not lie in giving up the activity but changing the inner ‘doer ego’ through right understanding and introspectively change from Ahankara to Asmita. Of the several techniques that have been recommended for this, Sri Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita says ‘the fire called true knowledge of the self burns the action’ .Through the right knowledge, the Ahankara is removed resulting in complete freedom from the distresses of life including the so called executive stresses. How can knowledge burn an activity? Spiritual knowledge has especially no connection with activity. Knowledge has nothing to do with action directly. It is directly connected with ignorance. Knowledge has its role in removing the ignorance. Ignorance gives rise to Ahankara. What is this right knowledge of self? The right knowledge is to realize that it is really the universal intelligence that is doing the work using ‘me’, the doer ego, as an instrument .Ignorance of this knowledge obviously results in doership and Ahankara. With the dawn of the right knowledge that ‘ I am only an instrument in the hands of the divine universal will or the universal ego’, the Ahankara gets burnt. The moment the identification with this limited ‘I’, the Ahankara goes, the ‘doer’ falls and the attachment to the action also drops. Then the burden of ego is dissolved.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Here, the question that needs to be addressed is, how can such a person with no ‘doer ego’ function in this world after it has been completely burnt ? How can any one function efficiently without an intense commitment to the activity on hand? The answer comes from the following proclamation of the scriptures. After attaining this true spiritual knowledge, although the doer ego does not exist in its earlier form, its functional aspect continues to be available with all its capabilities. Hence the practically useful functional abilities that are necessary for survival and doing good to others etc., do not go away, but the snow balling effect of the repercussions of good and bad actions(called vasanas) are completely erased. The example for this is that of a burnt rope.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Krishna says that even after the action is burnt by the fire of knowledge, he continues to function with an ego with utmost efficiency. A burnt rope that is not disturbed has exactly the same appearance as before but cannot act any more like a rope. Another useful example of a burnt ego is that of a burnt seed which has the same size, shape and appearance as a live seed but it has lost its potential to sprout any more. This seed does not give rise to any branches and reproduce more seeds. Same way a burnt action cannot gather unconscious impressions (vasanas) of suppressed emotions such as unfulfilled desires, hatred, anger, frustration etc. The activity goes on with a sense of duty and joy without any distress. Sri Ramakrishna says that the realized person goes on working like a wheel that continues to rotate and function with gathered momentum without collecting any mass on itself. It is like the way light removes the fear of darkness. Light literally has nothing to do with fear, but it was the non visibility of the obstacles in the room due to darkness that created the fear of a non-existent danger. And the moment he light is lit, things become clear and the fear drops off. If you were holding a gun to protect yourself from danger in the dark room, you drop that gun too. Light directly can not drop the gun but it appeared that light dropped the gun from your hand. Same way knowledge drops the identification of the doer. Once the doer is dissolved, the fever of activity also disappears.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The difference between an ordinary person’s Karma (the unconscious non erasable impressions created by any action )and the Karma of a Jnani is that, in the case of a Jnani, karmas are like lines drawn on the water and in case of an ordinary person the Karma is like line drawn on a stone. Even of you take a sharp instrument and draw a line on water the line will not last even for a second. On the other hand even if a soft substance like water falls on the stone repeatedly it can make lasting impressions as we see in river beds. This is to say that in case of a Jnani even if he does work of killing as a worrier he will not be affected but in case of an ordinary person who does the work with ahankara, even a respectable action of giving a charity, can lead to intense attachment and result in deep impressions (called punya vasana).</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">We claim credits for things for which we are not really responsible and we become a Kartru for that action. For example, we say ‘I breathe’. We cannot take even a single breath by our own effort if the system fails. If the “I”, the ahankara type of (bad) ego had to decide to do the job of breathing, we would have been dead by now. Many things which we are supposed to do, we conveniently forget and this can be one of them because taking breath is such a monotonous activity and hence this has been programmed into our nature and is the Asmita type of doer ego. God has given us legs and we are supposed to walk. How many of us walk regularly? God has given us joints and wanted us to regularly exercise them but we don’t do it and land up with ailments like arthritis. That is why God kept the activity like breathing to go on by itself but we claim that ‘I breathe’! Similarly we say ‘I have given birth’ to my son. Giving birth to another human being is such a great act of creation that only God can do that and in this process he uses us as an instrument .We are only the birth canal and nothing more than that! But we do have the responsibility to take care of them to develop into a healthy human being. When we say ‘I gave birth to him or her’ it is Kartrutva Ahankara which is bad, but when we take the responsibility of bringing up our children that is Kartrutva Asmita which is good.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When Buddha came back from his tapas of several years, his father said to him ‘I gave birth to you!’ Buddha replied, “Oh Father, when you were not born ‘I’ was there. I am coming from the time when this universe was created and you are also coming from the time of creation. We are meeting here in this life like two passengers meeting in a train. We both only happen to meet here as father and son!”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Another form of Kartrutva Ahankara is found in organizations. There are many responsible members in the structure of an organization to run it efficiently. Some times, some people want to take on every thing on their own shoulders and are never satisfied with any one else’s way of functioning and they tend to suffocate the other functionaries. Here the intentions may be good but the ego of one person wanting to be the Ahankara Kartru is the sickness that prevents him from functioning with a peace of mind and getting the joy of performing! In addition it also comes in the way of the growth of the other persons in the organization. Here, the litmus test is whether the activity is done using Asmita or Ahankara type of ego. If one can nurture the capacity to move from Ahankara to Asmita, then it will help them to enjoy the work they are doing .This helps one to grow. But if the work is done with Ahankara Kartrutva then the person will not grow.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When I was working as an engineer, one of my colleagues- a senior executive, wrote a very unsatisfactory report about his junior and sent it to the administration asking them for extension of his probationary period and not to make him a permanent employee although he was his close friend at a personal level. But we all knew that the junior was very capable, intelligent, and hard working. The administration asked me to solve this problem! I observed their way of functioning in the office for ten days. I noticed that, whenever there was any work in the office, the senior would ask the junior to attend to it and within a few minutes he would go back and check whether the work has been completed. If it was not completed he would conclude that the junior is not confident to tackle the problem, immediately jump in and complete the work himself. Poor fellow, the junior employee had to stand there as a mere spectator with folded hands! Now, this senior executive has a valid point when he said ‘look at his way of doing. How can you expect me to give him a good report?’ I interfered and explained to him that he, as a senior is not allowing the junior to grow. I advised him,’ give him an opportunity, give him time, let him do mistakes and you please correct his mistakes and help him to grow’. The senior understood and gave him time to finish the work at his own pace. When the junior was given the freedom and opportunity, in less than three months, he came up so well that the same senior, not only sent a good report but also mentioned that this junior should be working under him only. This is a very subtle Kartrutva ego! This Kartrutva ego undermined the Kartrutva responsibility of training a junior. This can be seen happening in many organizations where very efficient seniors cannot create and recognize capable juniors to take over!. Thus the Karturtva ego is not always bad . One needs to grow from the doer ego to the responsible ego</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">BHOKTRUTA</span></span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">…………….</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The second type of ego is the ‘experiencer’ ego or the Bhoktrutva Asmita. We require this experiencer ego to perceive and experience the inputs from the world around us through our sense organs such as eyes, ears etc. Hence the experiencer ego is incorporated into the act of perception. For example, the eyes carry the experience of light and its diversities.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Seeing is an experience and we are continuously guided by this experience.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sense perception is a direct experience for which we don’t have to depend upon anybody else’s experience (This is called pratyaksha pramaana). We say, ‘I have seen with my own eyes’. I see through my eyes and not through your eyes. We see using my experiencer ego and not someone else’s experiencer ego.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">This ‘I’ who sees cannot be replaced by any amount of technological development. When I was a boy of ten years, I went to an ophthalmologist to get my eyes tested. At that time the sophisticated technology was not developed. The doctor put a frame on my eyes and mounted a lens and he asked me whether I see clearly. After a few trials, I said that ‘wow, this lens is the best as ‘I’ can see clearly with this’. Then the doctor gave me a prescription of that particular power of glasses. Recently I had an eye checkup in USA and this time it was they used the latest computerized technology. A gadget was mounted on my eyes and some computer signals were generated. But this time also the decision was made based on my inputs as to when I see it blurred or when I see it clearly. The experiencer is important for right perception happen and it can not be replaced how ever much the technology develops. This experiencer ego is a life saving mechanism. The experience brings about responses that can invite immediate self protective actions. Like the experience of pain or suffering, experience of a foreign and dangerous virus entering our system through the nasal passage or a wrong food put in the stomach etc.. This perception immediately sets the system into action and helps us to protect ourselves. If there is discomfort, immediately the child cries to indicate that it is experiencing some thing which is not agreeable with the system and the mother immediately responds. That is the experiencer ego which is present even before the intellect is born. Therefore, the experiencer Asmita does not belong to intellect. For example, when a wrong and unhealthy material enters through the air that we breathe, immediately the nasal passage responds by sneezing.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">This is the experiencer ego which is the good part of our ego. Every part of our body has its own experiencer ego which protects not only itself but has the ability to respond suitably to protect the whole body.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The experiencer ego is also responsible for our sensitivity. We have the capacity not only to experience our own pains and sufferings, but we do experience the pain, suffering and joy of others. Even the pet dog in your house is sensitive to your pleasures and pains, your anger and joy etc.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we have seen how important the experiencer ego is, for the sake of healthy survival. It also becomes a problem when it functions the ahankara way and not the Asmita way..</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Sensitivity is a gift and a sign of evolution, but oversensitivity or wrong sensitivity can create problems. This oversensitivity can lead to unnecessary responses that can upset our emotional balance resulting in agitation, anxiety, depression etc. with the resultant health problems. For example, many do not have the sensitivity to be clean and neat .That is the reason the preparatory steps of ashtanga yoga prescribes shoucha or cleanliness (outside and inside) as one of the important steps to promote and maintain cleanliness and orderliness. This is one of the niyamas, the individual disciplines. But some times people can be so obsessed with cleanliness that their whole time is spent on cleaning and arranging things that they can do nothing beyond and their life revolves around that for ever. At that point they can only see dirt every where and that can turn into a disease called obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) !</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Same way, our good Bhoktrutva ego aids in healthy perception of smell so that we can smell good fragrance to enjoy and smell bad things to protect our system. But if one becomes over sensitive, he not only perceives unwanted smells but can be so sick that his life becomes miserable. On close observation, we can see that this is not because of sensitivity of the sense organ that he is in trouble but he is suffering because of his attachment to the sensitivity. Therefore the experiencer is Asmita which is useful and the attachment to the experience is Ahankara which is suffering!</span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"> <br/></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">JNATRUTVA</span></span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">……………….</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The third aspect is the identifier ego which is known as Jnatrutva Asmita. This identifier ego is very important and exists even in plants and animals. Because of this ego, a dog can recognize a dog, and not only as a dog but can distinguish a ‘she dog’ from a ‘he dog’. A he-dog not only recognizes a dog but he also recognizes whether the other one is she dog or he dog. If the other one is a she dog then he approaches it a wagging tail but the other dog happens to be a male then he is ready to fight or run away for life. This recognition is necessary for the sake of maintaining the species. This shows, though the dog does not know the word called dog, he knows that the other one belongs to his own species. This is its Jnatrutva ego. Similarly we also have identification ego, the Jnatrutva Asmita.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Even in human beings also, this Jnatrutva ego has the two dimensions of species and sex identity as seen in animals. The moment we see another human being we feel a form of comfort that we can not experience with animals or plants around us. We also have the ego that identifies ourselves as a man or a woman. This identification is so strong and deep that it will not leave us even in our dreams. In dreams also we belong to the same gender. This is the power of Jnatrutva Asmita. This identification is very important to maintain the social order and discipline.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In the society, the Jnatrutva Asmita has other forms of identities. A father has father’s Asmita, mother has mother’s Asmita, a child has child Asmita, a citizen has his citizen Asmita etc. this identity or Asmita provides the necessary social bonds and fixes their roles in the social organization.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">For a family to survive healthy and happy, all these forms of Asmita are very important. In the Indian society particularly there are such strict adherences to family structure that they observe their roles with religious rigor. We have such stories from Ramayana.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama had identified so intensely with his role of protecting them that Seeta, the elder brother’s wife, became his mother for the entire period of their stay in the forest. His deep respect for her made him always look at her with head down. This aspect has been brought out poetically by the poet Valmiki. When Seeta was abducted and was being taken away by air in Pushpakavimana by air by the evil Ravana, very thoughtfully Seeta bundled some of her ornaments and dropped on a hill when she heard some voices so that this may guide Rama to find her. . The monkey army on the hill had found them and had preserved them. When ram reached that place in search of Seeta and Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys showed them to Rama ,he says ‘Oh, lakshmana ,The memories of Seeta by looking at these ornaments are filling my eyes with tears .I just cannot identify them . Can you please help me?’ Lakshmana examines them and indentifies only her toe rings and says, ‘My dear brother, I am sure these are her toe rings as I would see them daily when I bow down to her feet. In the morning’. He could not identify the necklaces or bangles as he never would raise his head in front of mother Seeta. </span></span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><br/></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">That way, he sets an example for how a brother should respect his sister in law.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Just like we all have our roles (role ego or role Asmita) and responsibility for the health of the family, we also have a responsibility in the society too. In society a teacher has teacher’s Asmita and an executive has executive’s Asmita etc. Same way all the roles have their respective egos. If a person who is a teacher does not have that teacher’s ego he can not be an efficient teacher, like the way a father who does not have a father’s ego is not an efficient father. In an organization it is also necessary that we not only have to take care of our own Asmita but we also need to protect the organizational ego. For example if you are the chief of an organization and if you cannot uphold the ego of your juniors in the company in front of others, then not only the outsiders do not respect the organization but they loose their respect for you also.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The role ego is important. One has to have the core competency. Adi Shankaracharya in this context says that those who have this core competency are Adhikarinah. Therefore it has to be understood that the role ego is actually the responsibility of a person and is not for feeling egoistic about it. But unfortunately today when one assumes administrative positions, they become egotistic and tend to lose their responsibility. Especially when one gets into political positions it becomes a matter of Ahankara and not Asmita. It generally happens that people who occupy high positions end up as poor administrators because they are not competent to adhere to their Asmita ego to function with responsibility and end up becoming egoistic and self centered due to the Ahankara Bhoktrutva.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In Ramayana, when it was decided that Rama was to be enthroned as the prince, Sage Vasishtha says to Rama, ‘my dear Rama, this is a time for people of Ayodhya to celebrate as they are going to have a great prince, but for you, this is the time for contemplation as you are taking up the responsibility for the kingdom. Becoming a prince is to take up responsibility for the entire community by nurturing the king Asmita and give no room for the king Ahankara to capture your mind’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">When Asmita ego is at work the person identifies with the position, only during the work because this ego belongs to the position and not to the person. But ordinary persons do not understand this. The ignorance of the Ahankara ego is to identify with the position inseparably. This identification results in making a teacher behave like a teacher even while he is not teaching. A doctor becomes a doctor even in the shopping place. He may be playing cards in a club, but he thinks that he is doctor there too. They don’t realize that it is a big burden to carry that title wherever they go. We tend to forget how to be a simple common human being. When he is giving medicine to a patient, identifying with the position of a doctor gives him the freedom and authority to function efficiently as a medical doctor. But in the market place, being a doctor takes away this freedom which a common man can enjoy. We tend to forget that we are a common man and want to ride over others. This is like an actor is doing a role where he becomes a murderer or a criminal but he is not so otherwise when he is not on the stage. In fact, if only he actor does the role like that then only he can do it much more effectively than when he gets lost and becomes the role that he is playing! Once the famous Indian scientist and highly respected person in early nineteenth century Eswarachandra Vidyasagar was watching a stage drama being played in Calcutta sitting in the front seat he was totally absorbed in the play. A person who was acting like a bad person was giving such a trouble to the young lady character. It was all in the drama but Eswara Chandra Vidyasagar felt it so real that out of total rage he got up and hurled his shoe at that actor. The person immediately caught the shoe and paid his respects to the professor saying, “Sir, I received many many mementos for my acting but to day what I received in the form of your shoe is the most precious one and I would like to preserve it for the life time. Please allow me not to return this shoe to you,”</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Only then Eswara Chandra Vidyasagar, realized what happened! An actor does much better wok than a person who forgets this and gets attached to what role he is playing.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Once the governor of Kyoto Mr. Kitagagi went to a Zen master and gave his visiting card to the young boy sitting at the front desk to be presented to the master. The moment the young boy saw the card , he was alerted, filled with fear, because such a great person had come to see the master, and responded saying “Sir, please wait here , I shall show this card to the master and come back to you to take you in”. The boy rushed in and presented the card to the master.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The master was busy in talking to some body and casually looked at the card and continued his dialogue. The boy became restless and tried to draw the attention of the master to the card. Master replied, “Wait! Let me finish my work on hand before I attend to the card”. After a while, he slowly looked at the card from top to bottom and with a harsh tone said, “Why is this man here? Ask him to get out immediately!” The boy was surprised at the harshness in the tone of the master. The boy could not say any thing and hesitantly came back to Mr. Kitagagi who was eagerly waiting expecting the answer from the master to bring him in. But the boy said “sir, the master is busy.” Kitagagi said, ‘I can wait I am not in a hurry’. Now the boy was in trouble and and had to say, ‘Sir, may be he is not available today’ as he did not want to repeat the harsh words of the master to the governor. Looking at the discomfort of the boy the Governor asked him, “Tell me exactly what the master told you?”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The boy narrated every word that the master had said very apologetically. The governor went in to deep thinking for a moment. Suddenly he took the card and scratched the word ‘governor of Kyoto’ and asked the boy to produce it to the master. The boy did not feel comfortable. But very reluctantly he went in and showed the card. The moment the Zen master saw the card, with a great joy he told the boy ‘why is he sitting out side? Please bring him in”. In fact, the master got up from his seat, walked towards the door and said ‘Kitagagi, please come in’.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In this anecdote, one can see that the governor is necessary for a state. But he was carrying this burden of a governor even when he came to the Zen master.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">A seeker of truth has to drop all burdens. We tend to carry the burden and suffer because of inseparable identification of our ego with the position we hold.If this identifier ego can identify only at the time of being in that position, then it is Asmita and if the Jnatrutva ego becomes identified inseparably all the time and carries the burden around, then it becomes Ahankara type of Jnatrutva ego.</span></span></span></p>  \n\n<p align=\"justify\"><span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Thus we find the clear distinction between good ego(Asmita) and bad ego(Ahankara) ,in all three aspects of our being, i.e. the doer ego(Kartrutva), the experiencer ego( Bhokrutva) and identifier ego( Jnatrutva).This clear and useful distinction portrayed in Vedantic scriptures should help a sincere seeker to culture Asmita and get out of the bondage of Ahankara which is the ignorance that is repeatedly recognized as a hindrance to one’s spiritual growth .

My answer is because I am a Hindu. Next question some people have that follows is why Hindus believe in rebirth? I simply say that every one has some thing or the other they believe in the name of their religion, such as Jesus Christ is born to Virgin Mary and this is a belief. N the same way we believe in rebirth. I know that this is not real answer but that at least silence a casual enquirer.</span><br/><br/><span>The idea of rebirth is also useful in making certain situations light hearted. On one such occasion a friend an NRI living in US was very proud, saying how much that country gives importance to the recycling of the material once used and disposed off, that they have separate bins for waste paper and separate bins for plastic and separate for glass bottles and how little India pays attention to recycling. I tried to tell him in India actually our waste is also very less compared to west especially in those days. After some time I felt irritated because it is not in my capacity to implement any thing and I am a simple person; but he never listened to me. Finally I took chance to tell him, “no other culture thinks recycling as much as Hindu culture did, that we even thought of recycling our soul, and that is the reason we have the concept of rebirth!” he was at once stunned!</span><br/><br/><span>For a sincere and serious student there is a detailed explanation with minimum assumptions possible for rebirth on the basis of simple experiences and the scriptural support which I shall try to present here. The idea of rebirth is also useful in making the direction for our approach in life!</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna addresses it very directly and in a simple manner. According to him what is the body which is apparent reality is an ever changing reality. But in order for this to exist there must be an unchanging inner reality which is hidden behind and which is also non-apparent reality. Krishna says that we are the unchanging reality and what is changing in the form of death and decal is like when ever our dress is worn out we change it and put on new dress. Similarly we have passed through childhood youth and old age, and we will come back in new body. The underlying reality which is we are can not be cut by sword or burnt by fire or wet by water. Where there is no question of birth and death where is the question of rebirth! But we need to experience that we are that undying principle and what we see as dying is the unreal. This is where Hindu philosophy gives the methods of Sadhana for achieving that experiential state.</span><br/><br/><span>How can we experience that unchanging aspect within us? The process is of translating this idea into experience is called meditation. I meditation we sit comfortably and consciously de-identify from the physical body, and then develop absolute nonattachment from Prana and mind which is pranic personality and mental personality- pranamaya kosa and manomaya kosa, as further journey de-identify from intellectual and bliss personality- vijnanamaya and anandamaya kosas deep within, and finally be that and finally be that which is non of these personalities and you are mere awareness. This is described in Taittiriya upanisad as the following sloka</span><br/><br/><span>Tatra Annamayam Atmanam upasankramati. Pranamayam Atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Manomayam Atmanam Upasankramati. Vijnanamayam atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Anandamayam Atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Yato vacho na nivartante Aprapya manasa saha Anandam brahmano vidvan…</span><br/><br/><span>The student then rises beyond the identification of physical personality and pranic or life force personality and then he rises above the level of mental and intellectual personalities and finally he goes beyond the bliss personality and then becomes one with the Brahman which is beyond all states which can be reached by mind or intellect or emotions. This is not only a philosophy but the Upanishad gives it as the method of spiritual practice or reaching or realizing the goal of life.</span><br/><br/><span>The personalities from annamaya kosa to anandamaya kosa are of the quality of coming and going and that which is beyond is not the same and that we are. In other words, truly speaking we do not belong to that aspect which is coming and going and we are the one beyond. Therefore the Upanishads also mention that one who realizes that will not have any bondage.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another logic Upanishad gives to explain about our existence beyond this changing physical body and its various aspects. This is also given in a simple way in Bhagavad-Gita.</span><br/><br/><span>Dehinosmin yatha dehe kaumaram yavvanam jara,</span><br/><br/><span>tatha dehantara prapti, Dheerah tatrana muhyati. 2-12</span><br/><br/><span>Jatasyahi dhruvo mrityuh, ……2-27</span><br/><br/><span>We are the ‘dehi’ one who has the body and like the way we remain through the body ‘deha’ as it is undergoing the changes such as childhood, youth, adulthood and finally dies, in the same way we remain one body after another body too and this does not depend upon your consciousness! One, who knows about this truth, is not affected by birth and death.</span><br/><br/><span>We can agree to the idea that we are behind the flow of life called childhood youth and adulthood etc, but several questions rise as a result of this way of looking at life. These are as follows.</span><br/><br/><span>1. Can we explain the mechanism with little more clarity how this process of coming back in a new body takes place?</span><br/><span>2. What brings about in to new life?</span><br/><span>3. How can I modify my life with this knowledge?</span><br/><span>4. Why don’t we remember about our previous life or lives?</span><br/><br/><span>In order to understand these ideas some of the passages in Prasnopanishad are useful, when we try to look at them comparing them with day to day experience in life.</span><br/><br/><span>In Prasnopanishad the sage Pippalada, states that we are all born with life force which is called as Prana and this Prana is responsible for all the activities going on in this body.</span><br/><br/><span>The only one form of energy we get that we know of is the suns energy in the form of food we eat! The sage appears to be hinting us that apart from the energy we consume in the form of food there is another form of energy called ‘Prana’ which is responsible for all activities. This Prana is the grosser manifestation of the self which is in subtler form than even the mind and intellect realm. The ‘self’ drives the mind and which in turn influences the Prana and this Prana manifests that as activity at the body level. For example the soul or self having a thought of desire to see first of all creates the eye. Then this desire further becomes a force called Prana in the eyes and same thing will see through the eyes!</span><br/><br/><span>At thought level we don’t have any instrumentation for finding or proving and intention is much more subtle than that. Even when thought becomes Prana also we can not find out through instruments. But this aspect we can experience that we desire to see and we see through the instrument called eye and we desire to walk and we walk through the instrument called legs, etc.</span><br/><br/><span>Though this Prana within the body is same every where, depending upon the nature of activity this Prana is divided into five branches called Prana Apana, Vyana, Udana and Samana. These are not different Pranas but they are different types of functioning modes inside the body. While describing these Panca (five) Pranas excepting a portion of Udana the activities of all the other Pranas can be understood easily by observing the activities the respective Prana does in our body. For example, activities such as respiration is because of Prana the rhythmic up and down or in and out activity, urination and bowel movement etc are all the responsibility of Apana the downward Prana, Udana the upward Prana creates the activities such as seeing hearing thinking and similar activities. These are explained in slokas iii-5,6, of Prasna Upanishad.</span><br/><br/><span>In addition in sloka iii-7 an interesting point is brought about by the Upanishad teacher. Pippalada says, Udana is also responsible for taking you to heaven or auspicious worlds depending upon the auspicious deeds one performed in this world and the world of suffering for the acts of suffering one does in this world!</span><br/><br/><span>This can be simply taken in a mystic way saying that there are ‘heaven and hell’ some where in the space and one will go to the place as per once deeds. By taking it like that it will no more be logical and we loose some important pointers Upanishad it trying to convey to us. Let me try to understand it from the point of our experience in normal life of any individual.</span><br/><br/><span>The scriptures indicate and the modern science also accepts that our body is like a flowing river where water is constantly changing and fresh water is coming. Similar to that in our body also the old cells are dying and going out and new cells are taking birth and we are therefore constantly changing. A famous philosopher said that we can not put our foot in the same river twice because by the time you put your foot second time the river has already flown and new waters are there. But this needs to be further extended by saying that even your foot is also not the same by the time you put it for the second time. The cells in you foot also have changed.</span><br/><br/><span>Another point of experience we need to recognize is, let us consider the activity of Prana which is respiration. We breathe now and we are alive now, which means that the Prana belongs to the body here and now. Similarly the activity of Vyana which is conveying the information of some thing touching our skin and the message immediately goes to the brain which also means the activity of Vyana is here and now. In the same way the activity of seeing, hearing etc also belong to here and now. You can not say that we touch now and the sensation goes to the brain tomorrow, or I am feeling the sensation of touch of yesterday on my hand today in my brain. Which in other words, all these Prana activities belong to body. Keeping this in view it is very important to know that there is some thing of this Prana which does not belong to body.</span><br/><br/><span>There is one activity which does not belong to ‘here and now’. As I said earlier Udana is responsible for all the upward activities such as seeing hearing thinking which also includes memory. This memory we know is in several layers. A part of Udana is responsible also about the memory. Our memory does not belong to this body alone but it is the bridge between body and soul or consciousness. That is the reason though memory collects the information from the body it does not flow away along with body. It stays with us even after several days years stored in our subconscious levels. This memory is there even if the body is not there physically. That is the reason when we sleep the whole memory goes in to a shell in subconscious level. When we wake up then the memory comes back to the forefront.</span><br/><br/><span>At sub conscious level we have several layers. Our memory also will be stored in these subconscious levels. For example, we are not born with our names, name is given to us after our birth, and every one call us by that name and we learn to respond. We hear our name so many times that the name enters into sub conscious levels. That is the reason when we are sleeping along with several people and some one calls us by our name only we hear and others do not hear because the name they call will enter into our subconscious levels and for others it does not bother.</span><br/><br/><span>The same way the memory of our body is also deep in some layers of our mind. That is the reason we have the memory of the body even though we don’t have body. This is observed in several cases and the phenomenon is called as ‘phantom body experience’.</span><br/><br/><span>A friend of mine lost is thumb in a motor bike accident. The doctor put sutures for the hand where now there is no thumb. After ten days also my friend reported that the thumb which is not there is itching! Similarly we also come across people whose legs are amputated complain pain in that leg which is not there any longer. That means though the leg is not there the memory of the leg is there and is around the body part. If a leg is not there and the memory of the leg can exist, Hindu philosophy says even though there is no body the memory of the body exists around that body; which means even after death we exist and for some time we carry the memory of the body for some time with us.</span><br/><br/><span>Now let me summarize the thoughts we examined earlier. A part of Udana which carries our memory does not go away like all other Pranas go away as the body flows, since it does not belong to the body. We are soul or self or consciousness which takes this part of Udana when we die along with us. This is like the intention that we talked earlier. When we have body we have an intention and we materialize that activity since we have the necessary equipment called body is there with us.</span><br/><br/><span>This kind of phenomenon has been demonstrated very effectively by Dr Satwant Pasricha in several cases where she could connect the memory of some children in this life can be traced to a child existed in the previous life.</span><br/><br/><span>Therefore what we store in our memory goes with us whether we have body or not. If body is there then we can give expression to what we have if it is good we give expression to good or in other words we do good in this birth and if we have bad in our memory from previous birth we do bad. That is why in Hindu philosophy when one dies; symbolically we tap the head and say that the Prana of a person goes from the head. This is known as ‘Kapala moksha’.</span><br/><br/><span>The body memory stays with the soul for fourteen days. How our sages came to this idea we really do not know and they have therefore prescribed that we need to take care of the departed soul for thirteen days. Each day the son or who so ever is conducting the ceremonies will wake up and give him bath and offer prayers and feed him or her with the choicest food items for next thirteen days. On the fourteenth day all the family members are invited and amidst chanting of good Sanskrit verses from Upanishad bid final farewell to the soul which is supposed to be in the home premises for all these days. The scholars also say that the soul thus will feel satisfied that we took care of it.</span><br/><br/><span>When I joined as an engineer freshly graduated from college, I had a very senior engineer who was my super boss. He was superintending engineer and wanted desperately to become chief engineer. The whole office knows about how desperate he was and behind his back they made fun of his attitude. That super boss in addition had a great faith in the power of god and so called spiritual or godly people. He is also very religious and the moment he would see any temple in his way he would stop and bow his head towards god and pray that he should become chief engineer immediately. Every morning he has to tell the story to his subordinates about his dream where in he has seen himself as chief engineer at this project or that project! When ever the superiors call him he would say passionately that they must be calling him to personally tell him that he is going to be chief engineer. Any person looking like dressed in spiritual attire he would at once fall at his feet and ask for his blessings that he will become chief engineer!</span><br/><br/><span>One day I happened to reach office late and I didn’t want especially my boss to see me coming late, obviously. But to my bad luck as I rushed into the elevator I found this super boss already in the elevator alone! The lift door closed and it started moving up. To my shock I found my boss suddenly at my feet and asking me, ‘Raghuram, bless me that I become chief engineer’, I said, ‘sir, what is this you are so senior and I am just new entry how can I say any thing’? He replied, ‘Raghuram I heard yesterday some people talking that you also meditate and it is said that those who meditate will have powers. May be you have some powers so I want you to bless me’. With uneasy feeling I said, ‘sir, what will anybody think if he sees us’? ‘That is why I am catching you in the elevator, nobody can see us’ was his immediate reply! By the time we reached our floor we came out and he now turned to me in front of all asking, ‘Raghuram, why are you late to the office’? I was surprised because just now he was at my feet and now suddenly he became my boss!</span><br/><br/><span>This man was given to all kinds of vices and abused his body with drinking and smoking. As a result he developed sclerosis of liver and eventually was in deep coma. We, friends were by his side in hospital as his heart lung machines are working not allowing him to die. Ten days are over and the doctors also have very little hope for his recovery. People say that just as before dying the lamp glows bright life also shows a spark before the final end comes. That evening suddenly we found some little movement in his body which has been lying lifeless all these ten days recognizing that he is regaining consciousness I gave my hand in his hand and in his ears said to him, ‘sir, don’t worry. Things will be alright and doctors say you are doing fine and once you gain strength we will go home and you will be alright’! I only thought I have to give him some positive suggestions.</span><br/><br/><span>He recognizing my voice opened his eyes and told in feeble voice, ‘Raghuram, save me, I want to become chief engineer’!</span><br/><br/><span>I wondered at the strength of the desire that he nurtured to become chief engineer. It entered into such deep levels of subconscious states and unconscious states that he was in a total coma state living like vegetation for days and suddenly when he regained his consciousness for few minutes the thought surfaces so strongly at the top of his mind! I thought that this shows that the thought can be so deeply embedded in us. In few moments the inevitable happened and he died but I am sure his soul would have carried this thought of wanting to become chief engineer and would come back on this earth with a preformed agenda that he wants to become chief engineer. In the next birth he would acquire new impressions from the new environment and he restlessly runs to become some thing!</span><br/><br/><span>That is the reason our elders say that don’t keep in mind such thoughts which can make you restless and agitated so that that forms the investment for the future life. What we do in this life is the investment for the next life. Keep in deep memory things which are pleasant and happy s that in the future life you will make your life happy and if you nurture the thought that you are bound you will be bound and if you nurture the thought that you are free you will be free. People like Krishna and all are born free and have no bondage. When you are born as free person then you will enjoy the life blissfully with out any struggle.</span><br/><br/><span>Another positive note by looking at this way about life is that one need not feel bad that so much of life is already spent with out nurturing any good because what you do now on will be useful and you can shape your life.</span><br/><br/><span>Let me summarize the thoughts as follows.</span><br/><br/><span>We are a combination of aspects which have the qualities of birth and death called body mind complex and the aspect which is eternal which is known as soul or consciousness. We continue our journey even after death in the same manner that we give up worn out dress to new dress. Deep inside our activities are propelled by the aspect deep in our memory which is created in Udana. This aspect of Prana does not finish with the body but at the time of death we carry this memory with us the soul and we create another body suitable to fulfill these unfulfilled desires. If we carry bad memories of destruction, violence then, we come back with destruction and violence. On the other hand if we nurture in our memory good thoughts and peaceful ideas our life will be peaceful and joyful. Therefore Vedanta says that there is a definite reason for nurturing good not just for the sake of others but for our sake and our rebirth! When the sage in Prasnopanishad says punya loka and papa loka, they are not any where outside but they are what we create around us here.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>When ever any non Indian of non Hindu comes to know that I am not only a Hindu but I also give talks on Hindu philosophy immediate stock question he/she will have is, ‘do you believe in rebirth’, or ‘why do Hindu’s believe in rebirth?’</span><br/><br/><span>Similarly when ever I conduct a seminar in Germany or Austria one of the interesting topics for discussions is rebirth!</span><br/><br/><span>I some times feel like being naughty and tell them that yes I believe in and their immediate question is why?

I meditation we sit comfortably and consciously de-identify from the physical body, and then develop absolute nonattachment from Prana and mind which is pranic personality and mental personality- pranamaya kosa and manomaya kosa, as further journey de-identify from intellectual and bliss personality- vijnanamaya and anandamaya kosas deep within, and finally be that and finally be that which is non of these personalities and you are mere awareness. This is described in Taittiriya upanisad as the following sloka</span><br/><br/><span>Tatra Annamayam Atmanam upasankramati. Pranamayam Atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Manomayam Atmanam Upasankramati. Vijnanamayam atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Anandamayam Atmanam Upasankramati</span><br/><br/><span>Yato vacho na nivartante Aprapya manasa saha Anandam brahmano vidvan…</span><br/><br/><span>The student then rises beyond the identification of physical personality and pranic or life force personality and then he rises above the level of mental and intellectual personalities and finally he goes beyond the bliss personality and then becomes one with the Brahman which is beyond all states which can be reached by mind or intellect or emotions. This is not only a philosophy but the Upanishad gives it as the method of spiritual practice or reaching or realizing the goal of life.</span><br/><br/><span>The personalities from annamaya kosa to anandamaya kosa are of the quality of coming and going and that which is beyond is not the same and that we are. In other words, truly speaking we do not belong to that aspect which is coming and going and we are the one beyond. Therefore the Upanishads also mention that one who realizes that will not have any bondage.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another logic Upanishad gives to explain about our existence beyond this changing physical body and its various aspects. This is also given in a simple way in Bhagavad-Gita.</span><br/><br/><span>Dehinosmin yatha dehe kaumaram yavvanam jara,</span><br/><br/><span>tatha dehantara prapti, Dheerah tatrana muhyati. 2-12</span><br/><br/><span>Jatasyahi dhruvo mrityuh, ……2-27</span><br/><br/><span>We are the ‘dehi’ one who has the body and like the way we remain through the body ‘deha’ as it is undergoing the changes such as childhood, youth, adulthood and finally dies, in the same way we remain one body after another body too and this does not depend upon your consciousness! One, who knows about this truth, is not affected by birth and death.</span><br/><br/><span>We can agree to the idea that we are behind the flow of life called childhood youth and adulthood etc, but several questions rise as a result of this way of looking at life. These are as follows.</span><br/><br/><span>1. Can we explain the mechanism with little more clarity how this process of coming back in a new body takes place?</span><br/><span>2. What brings about in to new life?</span><br/><span>3. How can I modify my life with this knowledge?</span><br/><span>4. Why don’t we remember about our previous life or lives?</span><br/><br/><span>In order to understand these ideas some of the passages in Prasnopanishad are useful, when we try to look at them comparing them with day to day experience in life.</span><br/><br/><span>In Prasnopanishad the sage Pippalada, states that we are all born with life force which is called as Prana and this Prana is responsible for all the activities going on in this body.</span><br/><br/><span>The only one form of energy we get that we know of is the suns energy in the form of food we eat! The sage appears to be hinting us that apart from the energy we consume in the form of food there is another form of energy called ‘Prana’ which is responsible for all activities. This Prana is the grosser manifestation of the self which is in subtler form than even the mind and intellect realm. The ‘self’ drives the mind and which in turn influences the Prana and this Prana manifests that as activity at the body level. For example the soul or self having a thought of desire to see first of all creates the eye. Then this desire further becomes a force called Prana in the eyes and same thing will see through the eyes!</span><br/><br/><span>At thought level we don’t have any instrumentation for finding or proving and intention is much more subtle than that. Even when thought becomes Prana also we can not find out through instruments. But this aspect we can experience that we desire to see and we see through the instrument called eye and we desire to walk and we walk through the instrument called legs, etc.</span><br/><br/><span>Though this Prana within the body is same every where, depending upon the nature of activity this Prana is divided into five branches called Prana Apana, Vyana, Udana and Samana. These are not different Pranas but they are different types of functioning modes inside the body. While describing these Panca (five) Pranas excepting a portion of Udana the activities of all the other Pranas can be understood easily by observing the activities the respective Prana does in our body. For example, activities such as respiration is because of Prana the rhythmic up and down or in and out activity, urination and bowel movement etc are all the responsibility of Apana the downward Prana, Udana the upward Prana creates the activities such as seeing hearing thinking and similar activities. These are explained in slokas iii-5,6, of Prasna Upanishad.</span><br/><br/><span>In addition in sloka iii-7 an interesting point is brought about by the Upanishad teacher. Pippalada says, Udana is also responsible for taking you to heaven or auspicious worlds depending upon the auspicious deeds one performed in this world and the world of suffering for the acts of suffering one does in this world!</span><br/><br/><span>This can be simply taken in a mystic way saying that there are ‘heaven and hell’ some where in the space and one will go to the place as per once deeds. By taking it like that it will no more be logical and we loose some important pointers Upanishad it trying to convey to us. Let me try to understand it from the point of our experience in normal life of any individual.</span><br/><br/><span>The scriptures indicate and the modern science also accepts that our body is like a flowing river where water is constantly changing and fresh water is coming. Similar to that in our body also the old cells are dying and going out and new cells are taking birth and we are therefore constantly changing. A famous philosopher said that we can not put our foot in the same river twice because by the time you put your foot second time the river has already flown and new waters are there. But this needs to be further extended by saying that even your foot is also not the same by the time you put it for the second time. The cells in you foot also have changed.</span><br/><br/><span>Another point of experience we need to recognize is, let us consider the activity of Prana which is respiration. We breathe now and we are alive now, which means that the Prana belongs to the body here and now. Similarly the activity of Vyana which is conveying the information of some thing touching our skin and the message immediately goes to the brain which also means the activity of Vyana is here and now. In the same way the activity of seeing, hearing etc also belong to here and now. You can not say that we touch now and the sensation goes to the brain tomorrow, or I am feeling the sensation of touch of yesterday on my hand today in my brain. Which in other words, all these Prana activities belong to body. Keeping this in view it is very important to know that there is some thing of this Prana which does not belong to body.</span><br/><br/><span>There is one activity which does not belong to ‘here and now’. As I said earlier Udana is responsible for all the upward activities such as seeing hearing thinking which also includes memory. This memory we know is in several layers. A part of Udana is responsible also about the memory. Our memory does not belong to this body alone but it is the bridge between body and soul or consciousness. That is the reason though memory collects the information from the body it does not flow away along with body. It stays with us even after several days years stored in our subconscious levels. This memory is there even if the body is not there physically. That is the reason when we sleep the whole memory goes in to a shell in subconscious level. When we wake up then the memory comes back to the forefront.</span><br/><br/><span>At sub conscious level we have several layers. Our memory also will be stored in these subconscious levels. For example, we are not born with our names, name is given to us after our birth, and every one call us by that name and we learn to respond. We hear our name so many times that the name enters into sub conscious levels. That is the reason when we are sleeping along with several people and some one calls us by our name only we hear and others do not hear because the name they call will enter into our subconscious levels and for others it does not bother.</span><br/><br/><span>The same way the memory of our body is also deep in some layers of our mind. That is the reason we have the memory of the body even though we don’t have body. This is observed in several cases and the phenomenon is called as ‘phantom body experience’.</span><br/><br/><span>A friend of mine lost is thumb in a motor bike accident. The doctor put sutures for the hand where now there is no thumb. After ten days also my friend reported that the thumb which is not there is itching! Similarly we also come across people whose legs are amputated complain pain in that leg which is not there any longer. That means though the leg is not there the memory of the leg is there and is around the body part. If a leg is not there and the memory of the leg can exist, Hindu philosophy says even though there is no body the memory of the body exists around that body; which means even after death we exist and for some time we carry the memory of the body for some time with us.</span><br/><br/><span>Now let me summarize the thoughts we examined earlier. A part of Udana which carries our memory does not go away like all other Pranas go away as the body flows, since it does not belong to the body. We are soul or self or consciousness which takes this part of Udana when we die along with us. This is like the intention that we talked earlier. When we have body we have an intention and we materialize that activity since we have the necessary equipment called body is there with us.</span><br/><br/><span>This kind of phenomenon has been demonstrated very effectively by Dr Satwant Pasricha in several cases where she could connect the memory of some children in this life can be traced to a child existed in the previous life.</span><br/><br/><span>Therefore what we store in our memory goes with us whether we have body or not. If body is there then we can give expression to what we have if it is good we give expression to good or in other words we do good in this birth and if we have bad in our memory from previous birth we do bad. That is why in Hindu philosophy when one dies; symbolically we tap the head and say that the Prana of a person goes from the head. This is known as ‘Kapala moksha’.</span><br/><br/><span>The body memory stays with the soul for fourteen days. How our sages came to this idea we really do not know and they have therefore prescribed that we need to take care of the departed soul for thirteen days. Each day the son or who so ever is conducting the ceremonies will wake up and give him bath and offer prayers and feed him or her with the choicest food items for next thirteen days. On the fourteenth day all the family members are invited and amidst chanting of good Sanskrit verses from Upanishad bid final farewell to the soul which is supposed to be in the home premises for all these days. The scholars also say that the soul thus will feel satisfied that we took care of it.</span><br/><br/><span>When I joined as an engineer freshly graduated from college, I had a very senior engineer who was my super boss. He was superintending engineer and wanted desperately to become chief engineer. The whole office knows about how desperate he was and behind his back they made fun of his attitude. That super boss in addition had a great faith in the power of god and so called spiritual or godly people. He is also very religious and the moment he would see any temple in his way he would stop and bow his head towards god and pray that he should become chief engineer immediately. Every morning he has to tell the story to his subordinates about his dream where in he has seen himself as chief engineer at this project or that project! When ever the superiors call him he would say passionately that they must be calling him to personally tell him that he is going to be chief engineer. Any person looking like dressed in spiritual attire he would at once fall at his feet and ask for his blessings that he will become chief engineer!</span><br/><br/><span>One day I happened to reach office late and I didn’t want especially my boss to see me coming late, obviously. But to my bad luck as I rushed into the elevator I found this super boss already in the elevator alone! The lift door closed and it started moving up. To my shock I found my boss suddenly at my feet and asking me, ‘Raghuram, bless me that I become chief engineer’, I said, ‘sir, what is this you are so senior and I am just new entry how can I say any thing’? He replied, ‘Raghuram I heard yesterday some people talking that you also meditate and it is said that those who meditate will have powers. May be you have some powers so I want you to bless me’. With uneasy feeling I said, ‘sir, what will anybody think if he sees us’? ‘That is why I am catching you in the elevator, nobody can see us’ was his immediate reply! By the time we reached our floor we came out and he now turned to me in front of all asking, ‘Raghuram, why are you late to the office’? I was surprised because just now he was at my feet and now suddenly he became my boss!</span><br/><br/><span>This man was given to all kinds of vices and abused his body with drinking and smoking. As a result he developed sclerosis of liver and eventually was in deep coma. We, friends were by his side in hospital as his heart lung machines are working not allowing him to die. Ten days are over and the doctors also have very little hope for his recovery. People say that just as before dying the lamp glows bright life also shows a spark before the final end comes. That evening suddenly we found some little movement in his body which has been lying lifeless all these ten days recognizing that he is regaining consciousness I gave my hand in his hand and in his ears said to him, ‘sir, don’t worry. Things will be alright and doctors say you are doing fine and once you gain strength we will go home and you will be alright’! I only thought I have to give him some positive suggestions.</span><br/><br/><span>He recognizing my voice opened his eyes and told in feeble voice, ‘Raghuram, save me, I want to become chief engineer’!</span><br/><br/><span>I wondered at the strength of the desire that he nurtured to become chief engineer. It entered into such deep levels of subconscious states and unconscious states that he was in a total coma state living like vegetation for days and suddenly when he regained his consciousness for few minutes the thought surfaces so strongly at the top of his mind! I thought that this shows that the thought can be so deeply embedded in us. In few moments the inevitable happened and he died but I am sure his soul would have carried this thought of wanting to become chief engineer and would come back on this earth with a preformed agenda that he wants to become chief engineer. In the next birth he would acquire new impressions from the new environment and he restlessly runs to become some thing!</span><br/><br/><span>That is the reason our elders say that don’t keep in mind such thoughts which can make you restless and agitated so that that forms the investment for the future life. What we do in this life is the investment for the next life. Keep in deep memory things which are pleasant and happy s that in the future life you will make your life happy and if you nurture the thought that you are bound you will be bound and if you nurture the thought that you are free you will be free. People like Krishna and all are born free and have no bondage. When you are born as free person then you will enjoy the life blissfully with out any struggle.</span><br/><br/><span>Another positive note by looking at this way about life is that one need not feel bad that so much of life is already spent with out nurturing any good because what you do now on will be useful and you can shape your life.</span><br/><br/><span>Let me summarize the thoughts as follows.</span><br/><br/><span>We are a combination of aspects which have the qualities of birth and death called body mind complex and the aspect which is eternal which is known as soul or consciousness. We continue our journey even after death in the same manner that we give up worn out dress to new dress. Deep inside our activities are propelled by the aspect deep in our memory which is created in Udana. This aspect of Prana does not finish with the body but at the time of death we carry this memory with us the soul and we create another body suitable to fulfill these unfulfilled desires. If we carry bad memories of destruction, violence then, we come back with destruction and violence. On the other hand if we nurture in our memory good thoughts and peaceful ideas our life will be peaceful and joyful. Therefore Vedanta says that there is a definite reason for nurturing good not just for the sake of others but for our sake and our rebirth! When the sage in Prasnopanishad says punya loka and papa loka, they are not any where outside but they are what we create around us here.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Thoughts of rebirth in the light of Vedanta philosophy","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":61,"uuid":"3b9cc8f4-a36a-4a14-bcc4-246e83c73031","title":"EGO ACCORDING TO VEDANTHA - 2-","slug":"ego-according-to-vedantha-2","markdown":"<p><span>KARTRUTVA ASMITA</span><br/><br/><span>Doer ego is responsible for carrying out the actions that we do and we need to do.</span><br/><span>For example we have legs and in order to keep the legs in good shape we need to walk. ‘I’ have to walk;’ I’ need to walk and this requires the ‘ego’ which is the good ego. If we do not have this ego we can not take care of our legs. We can not keep our body in a healthy state. Say you are convinced that doing yoga is good for your health and you have made a resolve that you shall do yoga regularly. If there is no strong ‘doer ego’, you can miss out on the regularity in spite of being convinced about its benefits. Thus a strong ‘doer ego’ is necessary under all circumstances so that we do not become parasites on the society. In order to promote this good doer ego, wise people said that if you do not take care of your ‘self’, you are a sinner. This concept of sin in this context was probably introduced to encourage us to recognize that if one does not put in the right amount of effort through a strong doer ego, he cannot be happy.</span><br/><br/><span>A young man saw a caterpillar just turned into a butterfly and fighting to come out of its cocoon. With lot of sympathy for the struggling insect, he took a pair of scissors and very carefully cut the shell to release the butterfly out of its cocoon and was very happy about his success in helping a small creature.</span><br/><br/><span>Side by side, another butterfly also struggled and came out of its cocoon by itself.</span><br/><span>Finally when both of them were out in the free world, the butterfly that did not fight or struggle could not fly because the wings had not grown fully. On the other hand, the one which had struggled through its life had strong wings and flew freely. We realize that even a butterfly has to nurture a strong doer ego in order to grow fully! Same way we have to do what we need to do, in order to grow. This is the positive ‘doer ego’.</span><br/><br/><span>There are two ways in which one can utilize this Kartrutva. The doer ego can be called Asmita when we do the work with a sense of duty which is the good Kartrutva ego. The same Kartrutva becomes Ahankara or ‘bad Kartrutva ego’ when we try to claim the ‘doership’. In the present day life style we see many stress related problems in high profile performers (executive stress) that can go on to many killer diseases such as hypertension and heart disease. The doer ego of such a workaholic person is very strong and effective that produces great results .But the problems of stress that goes with it is basically created by the ‘ahankara’, (‘I am the doer’) that goes with it and not the Asmita ego. The problem of such an activity is not created by the activity, but by the doer. Hence the solution does not lie in giving up the activity but changing the inner ‘doer ego’ through right understanding and introspectively change from Ahankara to Asmita. Of the several techniques that have been recommended for this, Sri Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita says ‘the fire called true knowledge of the self burns the action’ .Through the right knowledge, the Ahankara is removed resulting in complete freedom from the distresses of life including the so called executive stresses. How can knowledge burn an activity? Spiritual knowledge has especially no connection with activity. Knowledge has nothing to do with action directly. It is directly connected with ignorance. Knowledge has its role in removing the ignorance. Ignorance gives rise to Ahankara. What is this right knowledge of self? The right knowledge is to realize that it is really the universal intelligence that is doing the work using ‘me’, the doer ego, as an instrument .Ignorance of this knowledge obviously results in doership and Ahankara. With the dawn of the right knowledge that ‘ I am only an instrument in the hands of the divine universal will or the universal ego’, the Ahankara gets burnt. The moment the identification with this limited ‘I’, the Ahankara goes, the ‘doer’ falls and the attachment to the action also drops. Then the burden of ego is dissolved.</span><br/><br/><span>Here, the question that needs to be addressed is, how can such a person with no ‘doer ego’ function in this world after it has been completely burnt ? How can any one function efficiently without an intense commitment to the activity on hand? The answer comes from the following proclamation of the scriptures. After attaining this true spiritual knowledge, although the doer ego does not exist in its earlier form, its functional aspect continues to be available with all its capabilities. Hence the practically useful functional abilities that are necessary for survival and doing good to others etc., do not go away, but the snow balling effect of the repercussions of good and bad actions(called vasanas) are completely erased. The example for this is that of a burnt rope.</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna says that even after the action is burnt by the fire of knowledge, he continues to function with an ego with utmost efficiency. A burnt rope that is not disturbed has exactly the same appearance as before but cannot act any more like a rope. Another useful example of a burnt ego is that of a burnt seed which has the same size, shape and appearance as a live seed but it has lost its potential to sprout any more. This seed does not give rise to any branches and reproduce more seeds. Same way a burnt action cannot gather unconscious impressions (vasanas) of suppressed emotions such as unfulfilled desires, hatred, anger, frustration etc. The activity goes on with a sense of duty and joy without any distress. Sri Ramakrishna says that the realized person goes on working like a wheel that continues to rotate and function with gathered momentum without collecting any mass on itself. It is like the way light removes the fear of darkness. Light literally has nothing to do with fear, but it was the non visibility of the obstacles in the room due to darkness that created the fear of a non-existent danger. And the moment he light is lit, things become clear and the fear drops off. If you were holding a gun to protect yourself from danger in the dark room, you drop that gun too. Light directly can not drop the gun but it appeared that light dropped the gun from your hand. Same way knowledge drops the identification of the doer. Once the doer is dissolved, the fever of activity also disappears.</span><br/><span>The difference between an ordinary person’s Karma (the unconscious non erasable impressions created by any action )and the Karma of a Jnani is that, in the case of a Jnani, karmas are like lines drawn on the water and in case of an ordinary person the Karma is like line drawn on a stone. Even of you take a sharp instrument and draw a line on water the line will not last even for a second. On the other hand even if a soft substance like water falls on the stone repeatedly it can make lasting impressions as we see in river beds. This is to say that in case of a Jnani even if he does work of killing as a worrier he will not be affected but in case of an ordinary person who does the work with ahankara, even a respectable action of giving a charity, can lead to intense attachment and result in deep impressions (called punya vasana).</span><br/><br/><span>We claim credits for things for which we are not really responsible and we become a Kartru for that action. For example, we say ‘I breathe’. We cannot take even a single breath by our own effort if the system fails. If the “I”, the ahankara type of (bad) ego had to decide to do the job of breathing, we would have been dead by now. Many things which we are supposed to do, we conveniently forget and this can be one of them because taking breath is such a monotonous activity and hence this has been programmed into our nature and is the Asmita type of doer ego. God has given us legs and we are supposed to walk. How many of us walk regularly? God has given us joints and wanted us to regularly exercise them but we don’t do it and land up with ailments like arthritis. That is why God kept the activity like breathing to go on by itself but we claim that ‘I breathe’! Similarly we say ‘I have given birth’ to my son. Giving birth to another human being is such a great act of creation that only God can do that and in this process he uses us as an instrument .We are only the birth canal and nothing more than that! But we do have the responsibility to take care of them to develop into a healthy human being. When we say ‘I gave birth to him or her’ it is Kartrutva Ahankara which is bad, but when we take the responsibility of bringing up our children that is Kartrutva Asmita which is good.</span><br/><br/><span>When Buddha came back from his tapas of several years, his father said to him ‘I gave birth to you!’ Buddha replied, “Oh Father, when you were not born ‘I’ was there. I am coming from the time when this universe was created and you are also coming from the time of creation. We are meeting here in this life like two passengers meeting in a train. We both only happen to meet here as father and son!”</span><br/><br/><span>Another form of Kartrutva Ahankara is found in organizations. There are many responsible members in the structure of an organization to run it efficiently. Some times, some people want to take on every thing on their own shoulders and are never satisfied with any one else’s way of functioning and they tend to suffocate the other functionaries. Here the intentions may be good but the ego of one person wanting to be the Ahankara Kartru is the sickness that prevents him from functioning with a peace of mind and getting the joy of performing! In addition it also comes in the way of the growth of the other persons in the organization. Here, the litmus test is whether the activity is done using Asmita or Ahankara type of ego. If one can nurture the capacity to move from Ahankara to Asmita, then it will help them to enjoy the work they are doing .This helps one to grow. But if the work is done with Ahankara Kartrutva then the person will not grow.</span><br/><br/><span>When I was working as an engineer, one of my colleagues- a senior executive, wrote a very unsatisfactory report about his junior and sent it to the administration asking them for extension of his probationary period and not to make him a permanent employee although he was his close friend at a personal level. But we all knew that the junior was very capable, intelligent, and hard working. The administration asked me to solve this problem! I observed their way of functioning in the office for ten days. I noticed that, whenever there was any work in the office, the senior would ask the junior to attend to it and within a few minutes he would go back and check whether the work has been completed. If it was not completed he would conclude that the junior is not confident to tackle the problem, immediately jump in and complete the work himself. Poor fellow, the junior employee had to stand there as a mere spectator with folded hands! Now, this senior executive has a valid point when he said ‘look at his way of doing. How can you expect me to give him a good report?’ I interfered and explained to him that he, as a senior is not allowing the junior to grow. I advised him,’ give him an opportunity, give him time, let him do mistakes and you please correct his mistakes and help him to grow’. The senior understood and gave him time to finish the work at his own pace. When the junior was given the freedom and opportunity, in less than three months, he came up so well that the same senior, not only sent a good report but also mentioned that this junior should be working under him only. This is a very subtle Kartrutva ego! This Kartrutva ego undermined the Kartrutva responsibility of training a junior. This can be seen happening in many organizations where very efficient seniors cannot create and recognize capable juniors to take over!. Thus the Karturtva ego is not always bad . One needs to grow from the doer ego to the responsible ego.</span><br/><br/><span>-</span><em> to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><span>KARTRUTVA ASMITA</span><br/><br/><span>Doer ego is responsible for carrying out the actions that we do and we need to do.</span><br/><span>For example we have legs and in order to keep the legs in good shape we need to walk. ‘I’ have to walk;’ I’ need to walk and this requires the ‘ego’ which is the good ego.

Then the burden of ego is dissolved.</span><br/><br/><span>Here, the question that needs to be addressed is, how can such a person with no ‘doer ego’ function in this world after it has been completely burnt ? How can any one function efficiently without an intense commitment to the activity on hand? The answer comes from the following proclamation of the scriptures. After attaining this true spiritual knowledge, although the doer ego does not exist in its earlier form, its functional aspect continues to be available with all its capabilities. Hence the practically useful functional abilities that are necessary for survival and doing good to others etc., do not go away, but the snow balling effect of the repercussions of good and bad actions(called vasanas) are completely erased. The example for this is that of a burnt rope.</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna says that even after the action is burnt by the fire of knowledge, he continues to function with an ego with utmost efficiency. A burnt rope that is not disturbed has exactly the same appearance as before but cannot act any more like a rope. Another useful example of a burnt ego is that of a burnt seed which has the same size, shape and appearance as a live seed but it has lost its potential to sprout any more. This seed does not give rise to any branches and reproduce more seeds. Same way a burnt action cannot gather unconscious impressions (vasanas) of suppressed emotions such as unfulfilled desires, hatred, anger, frustration etc. The activity goes on with a sense of duty and joy without any distress. Sri Ramakrishna says that the realized person goes on working like a wheel that continues to rotate and function with gathered momentum without collecting any mass on itself. It is like the way light removes the fear of darkness. Light literally has nothing to do with fear, but it was the non visibility of the obstacles in the room due to darkness that created the fear of a non-existent danger. And the moment he light is lit, things become clear and the fear drops off. If you were holding a gun to protect yourself from danger in the dark room, you drop that gun too. Light directly can not drop the gun but it appeared that light dropped the gun from your hand. Same way knowledge drops the identification of the doer. Once the doer is dissolved, the fever of activity also disappears.</span><br/><span>The difference between an ordinary person’s Karma (the unconscious non erasable impressions created by any action )and the Karma of a Jnani is that, in the case of a Jnani, karmas are like lines drawn on the water and in case of an ordinary person the Karma is like line drawn on a stone. Even of you take a sharp instrument and draw a line on water the line will not last even for a second. On the other hand even if a soft substance like water falls on the stone repeatedly it can make lasting impressions as we see in river beds. This is to say that in case of a Jnani even if he does work of killing as a worrier he will not be affected but in case of an ordinary person who does the work with ahankara, even a respectable action of giving a charity, can lead to intense attachment and result in deep impressions (called punya vasana).</span><br/><br/><span>We claim credits for things for which we are not really responsible and we become a Kartru for that action. For example, we say ‘I breathe’. We cannot take even a single breath by our own effort if the system fails. If the “I”, the ahankara type of (bad) ego had to decide to do the job of breathing, we would have been dead by now. Many things which we are supposed to do, we conveniently forget and this can be one of them because taking breath is such a monotonous activity and hence this has been programmed into our nature and is the Asmita type of doer ego. God has given us legs and we are supposed to walk. How many of us walk regularly? God has given us joints and wanted us to regularly exercise them but we don’t do it and land up with ailments like arthritis. That is why God kept the activity like breathing to go on by itself but we claim that ‘I breathe’! Similarly we say ‘I have given birth’ to my son. Giving birth to another human being is such a great act of creation that only God can do that and in this process he uses us as an instrument .We are only the birth canal and nothing more than that! But we do have the responsibility to take care of them to develop into a healthy human being. When we say ‘I gave birth to him or her’ it is Kartrutva Ahankara which is bad, but when we take the responsibility of bringing up our children that is Kartrutva Asmita which is good.</span><br/><br/><span>When Buddha came back from his tapas of several years, his father said to him ‘I gave birth to you!’ Buddha replied, “Oh Father, when you were not born ‘I’ was there. I am coming from the time when this universe was created and you are also coming from the time of creation. We are meeting here in this life like two passengers meeting in a train. We both only happen to meet here as father and son!”</span><br/><br/><span>Another form of Kartrutva Ahankara is found in organizations. There are many responsible members in the structure of an organization to run it efficiently. Some times, some people want to take on every thing on their own shoulders and are never satisfied with any one else’s way of functioning and they tend to suffocate the other functionaries. Here the intentions may be good but the ego of one person wanting to be the Ahankara Kartru is the sickness that prevents him from functioning with a peace of mind and getting the joy of performing! In addition it also comes in the way of the growth of the other persons in the organization. Here, the litmus test is whether the activity is done using Asmita or Ahankara type of ego. If one can nurture the capacity to move from Ahankara to Asmita, then it will help them to enjoy the work they are doing .This helps one to grow. But if the work is done with Ahankara Kartrutva then the person will not grow.</span><br/><br/><span>When I was working as an engineer, one of my colleagues- a senior executive, wrote a very unsatisfactory report about his junior and sent it to the administration asking them for extension of his probationary period and not to make him a permanent employee although he was his close friend at a personal level. But we all knew that the junior was very capable, intelligent, and hard working. The administration asked me to solve this problem! I observed their way of functioning in the office for ten days. I noticed that, whenever there was any work in the office, the senior would ask the junior to attend to it and within a few minutes he would go back and check whether the work has been completed. If it was not completed he would conclude that the junior is not confident to tackle the problem, immediately jump in and complete the work himself. Poor fellow, the junior employee had to stand there as a mere spectator with folded hands! Now, this senior executive has a valid point when he said ‘look at his way of doing. How can you expect me to give him a good report?’ I interfered and explained to him that he, as a senior is not allowing the junior to grow. I advised him,’ give him an opportunity, give him time, let him do mistakes and you please correct his mistakes and help him to grow’. The senior understood and gave him time to finish the work at his own pace. When the junior was given the freedom and opportunity, in less than three months, he came up so well that the same senior, not only sent a good report but also mentioned that this junior should be working under him only. This is a very subtle Kartrutva ego! This Kartrutva ego undermined the Kartrutva responsibility of training a junior. This can be seen happening in many organizations where very efficient seniors cannot create and recognize capable juniors to take over!. Thus the Karturtva ego is not always bad . One needs to grow from the doer ego to the responsible ego.</span><br/><br/><span>-</span><em> to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"EGO ACCORDING TO VEDANTHA - 2-","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-02-17T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-02-17T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-02-17T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":62,"uuid":"d9f3ed60-8c84-4e81-baa6-0e654f679b63","title":"Ego according to Vedantha -1-","slug":"ego-according-to-vedantha-1","markdown":"<p align=\"justify\"><span>The concept of ego is neither ontological nor philosophical in my view.

Normally, in most spiritual circles ‘ego’ is looked down and is considered to be a big hurdle in the path of one’s spiritual journey. Several questions come up while accepting this concept. Let us try and find a logical understanding of this ‘ego’, so that we can utilize this highly simplified introspective knowledge for the healthy growth of the individual to live a happy life free from all distresses which is the goal of any spiritual seeker. Let us pause and think without any prejudice, if the ‘ego’ was only a big hurdle and, a poison why such a thing was created by God?? Like many things which are good in one area and dangerous in another area, my feeling has always been that ego also must have its good and bad aspects. It may be that we have interpreted it wrongly and overplayed its bad aspects and made it a big hurdle to one’s evolution. It is like the food which can be nourishing when taken in the right way, in the right place, in the right quantity and at the right time (in empty stomach) and can become a poison and destructive when the conditions are not right. It is not the fault of the food but the application is wrong. Similarly, according to Indian philosophy there are both the good and bad aspects of the ‘ego’, just like a sharp edged razor which can be used for killing some one brutally or saving someone through a life saving surgery. We discuss about ‘ego’ and think that only adults can understand and realize the impact of ego on one’s life as it is too philosophical. But an incident happened which surprised me to realize how even a simple child can also recognize this concept of’ ego’. A group of our friends were watching a documentary on yoga and its relevance to modern man in which there were several elite people who were being interviewed to give their ideas about yoga, yoga research and its application as a science etc.. The anchor person questioned one of the participants of the panel, about his opinion on yoga. He started talking about how much he is committed to scientific experimentation, how many papers in science he has published and how rigorously he is scientific in his temperament etc. Listening to this for about two minutes, a small girl of not more than eight years sitting next to me said very innocently, “Why is he talking about himself and not coming to the topic?” It was interesting to realize that , while an innocent young girl could understand what is ego and also that it is bad which the elite adult , the speaker, could not .What could be the reason ? There are several reasons. Let us understand how Indian scriptures understand this inner stuff called ‘ego’ and how it camouflages itself as we grow into adults.</span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span>Ego , the self, can have dual existence, (a) as a distinct entity (the observer mind) or (b) connected inseparably with all aspects of our personality ,the entire body mind consciousness complex. Ego exists not only in human beings but you can find it in entire creation. That means every thing in this manifested world has its own ‘being’ which distinguishes its ‘self’ from others. Hence it cannot be good or bad; it is only a self distinguishing quality of the organism. Animals have ego, plants have ego and even the matter has its ego. In case of physical matter, we may not use the word ‘ego’, but we call it as its innate property .Thus, ego of physical matter establishes its identity and individuality, manifests as its fixed property and is predictable. .For example water follows the law that under normal pressure and temperature, it becomes steam at one hundred degrees centigrade and turns into ice at zero degree temperature. It is the property of the water. This property inbuilt into its nature distinguishes it from other substances. This is what I call as the ego of nonliving physical world and all objects share their distinct ‘self’ or ‘ego’. Similarly plants also have their own individuality. For example, roots grow downwards into the soil in search of water. The genetic programming is to find water and not just a downward growth. Hence, if the roots happen to come across an obstacle of a huge rock on their way, they know how to negotiate themselves to reach the water. This clearly indicates the inbuilt intelligence that helps the plant to survive and is achieved through this programmed effort to strive to reach a goal. This ability and intention to pursue its goal is the ego of a plant. Thus, in case of living organisms the ego takes on the property of trying to protect its own existence in addition to its physical property .This can be established so clearly when we see small plants which start their small roots in small cracks in a wall. These little ones, as they continue to grow, send their roots into the wall in such a complex network that even the huge stone structure may give way over time although their aim was never to destroy the wall. This ‘ego’ makes the widespread roots of huge trees break open and lift off the heavily concreted road surfaces for their survival. This is the ego of living things that is characterized by the law of ‘survival instinct’.</span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span>Further in case of insects or animals, we can see this ego for survival or the survival instinct has an added advantage of mobility.

The anchor of the program picked up one of them and turned it around and left it on the sand in the opposite direction, the turtle wasted no time to turn around and proceed on its journey to the ocean! It is the ego of the turtle which makes it to do this way. It is the individuality which ensures its survival. This I call as the ‘good ego’, the very nature of the individual described as ‘Asmita’ in Vedanta.

This Krishna shows as if they are not competitive but they are complimentary. Accept the death as much as you accepted life and birth and death belong to body and things which are having coming and going qualities. Krishna says to Arjuna, ‘you are eternal and untouched by this death and birth. Like the way you have travelled through the childhood adulthood and old age in the same way you pass through this body and then through another body and so on. You can not be cut by sword or burnt by fire or killed by water. Just like you are not touched by these things, all others also are not touched by the death and birth.

Bhagavad-Gita suggests that even an ordinary sane person who has practiced righteousness has also reason to get into confusion unless he gets the higher dimension. He will not find solution in ordinary realms of right and wrong! *</span><br/><br/><span>* Krishna says to Arjuna that action and non action are two ways of involving in any situation both of them are alright and they are complimentary. Both of them are acceptable but the third thing he says the vikarma is not good and poisonous. Karma is doing and Akarma is not doing (a+Karma). Krishna says both of them are alright but he says vikarma is bad. Vikarma is normally translated as bad action or forbidden action! Some of the translators or interpreters even present it as torturing, killing or physically or mentally abusing is bad. I was having reservations about this way of interpreting because of the fact that there was no reason for Krishna to say this to Arjuna. One reason is that Arjuna always followed right actions and never took to wrong actions even though there were opportunities. Therefore when Krishna says don’t do Vikarma it can not be bad actions or forbidden actions. Another important aspect is that Arjuna does not even want to fight the war and instead he wants to run away from the battle. If it was right then Krishna does not have to give any philosophy. Suffice it to say to Arjuna that what you are thinking is right. *</span><br/><br/><span>*But that is not Krishna’s intention. The philosophical background he has given, helped Arjuna to take to fight the war in a yoga way. (Yogasthaha Kurukarmani!). The transformation that happened is that the action has no more the element of Vikarma! The question we need to understand therefore is what is meant by vikarma?*</span><br/><br/><span>*Let us take a simple household example to understand the concept of Vikarma:*</span><br/><br/><span>*You are watching the news program on TV and wife is busy in the kitchen preparing food. The kid two years old comes and says, ‘dad, can you help me?’. You are not in a mood to attend to him and say, ‘don’t disturb me now. Go to your mom I am busy,’ the mom from kitchen says, ‘take care of him please, what is busy work you are doing watching the news on tv you can watch it later.’ Even then you want to find an excuse, ‘no, taking care of the kid is mother’s responsibility and I am tired working in the office. She is surprised at the answer and says, ‘ok I shall take care and you will not have dinner.’ It is like veto. You can not do any thing, with great rejection in side you say in harsh tone to the child, ‘ok, tell me what it is?’ again the order comes from kitchen, ‘take care of him properly’. You can not even say loud. *</span><br/><br/><span>*If you observe what went on now you will see that you have created a split personality with in you. One part says take care of him as it is needed but on the other hand another part strongly says, ‘don’t take care let wife take care of the child’. Thus when we create a duel personality with in and do any activity this is called ‘Vikarma’. Vikarma according to Krishna is bad. We can also feel the same. Any activity we do in the form of Vikarma we do not enjoy and it becomes like a big burden. Your mind takes completely the posture of fighting. Your min is filled with anger and negativity towards wife and kid. Such an activity becomes a big stress on you. Similarly when ever we do not do an activity not peacefully but with repulsion within that non activity is also Vikarma and that activity also can not give us peace and relaxation. *</span><br/><br/><span>*By looking at this example we can see every activity we do or every non activity we prefer, almost ninety percent of the times we are only doing vikarma and not doing karma or a karma. We get up in the morning with an idea of going to the office, but once we get up we start complaining about getting up so early. This is vikarma. We have to go in the traffic and once we are there we just don’t go easily we continuously complain about the traffic getting irritated and upset at every step. This is vikarma. This vikarma is reaction and doing by creating a split personality within. Once we know that we need to do the activities why not take a position to do it whole heartedly. That belongs to inner understanding and inner correction. Any activity where we remove the vikarma aspect it becomes karma yoga. This helps us to rise above the third position vikarma. *</span><br/><br/><span>*Another important dimension Krishna gives to Arjuna is the concept that the creation can be divided into three divisions called satva rajas and tamas depending on their properties and actions etc. A simple observation of the creation can give us this aspect more clearly. If you look at a tree it can be divided into three aspects the root is tamas, the trunk is rajas and the flowers and foliage is the satva. We need all the three things for the tree to be alive. Similarly if we look at the human being we also have similarly three aspects, namely the feet is the tamas the middle portion of the body is rajas and the upper portion of the body is satva. All the three are necessary and what is the health of a system whether you take a tree or a human being is the harmony between all the three aspects. *</span><br/><br/><span>*There is nothing like one is good and one is bad. They all are required according to their activities. That is how the activities they do are also named as satva and rajas and tamas activities. The roots are in the soil and darkness all the times, therefore darkness is also tamas and they feed on slush and putrefied food so the putrefied food is tamas, similarly feet always carry the weight of the body and walks in dirty rough terrain. Therefore the activities of that nature are called as tamas activities. On the other hand our head things and plans etc. such an activity therefore is called as satva activity. Strictly speaking these are not in separate water tight compartments but they are in degrees of subtleties. Krishna gives further that these three gunas are there in the nature but you have to go beyond these three gunas so that you can easily without any reaction switch from one guna to other guna where ever it is necessary. Therefore Krishna gives the idea of the fourth state called the gunateetha which is the actual spiritual practice. You can reach guna teetha level only by developing non attachment with all the tree gunas. Thus in t his case also Krishna suggests the state beyond, and that is the purpose of life!*</span><br/><br/><span>*I have mentioned here only some ideas of how the world is made up of and it has different divisions such as good and bad, right and wrong etc and the purpose of teaching of Bhagavad-Gita is to take you beyond which is the purpose of life and purushartha,*</span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><em>presented at a conference NIMHANS</em><br/><em>By Sri NV Raghuram<br/><br/></em><span>* Wise person is one who knows that it is temporary he sees that things are going to change and will not be the same.

Freedom does not come with only one side of the coin it has both the good and bad which means human being can improve himself and can destroy himself. That is the reason human being also has a purpose rather responsibility for living. When we say he has responsibility it does not mean in the sense of pressure or burden but like a joyful play. He is not an isolated creature but he is part of the creation and the best part of it therefore he has the responsibility of the other creatures on the earth. This in Vedanta is called as ‘purushartha’, ‘/arthate iti purushah’/. Once this purushartha is understood then one can see that the society around him is for this purushartha the nature around him is for the sake of this purushartha and the whole development we see around can be for the sake of this purushartha.</span><br/><span>** One may raise the question in what way is it different form the concept of good and bad, right and wrong, and sin and virtue. The concept of these pairs of opposites can not take us above the level of selfishness of a human being. Once this selfishness one can use his intelligence to take care of this selfishness and say that why should I care for others, they have to take care of themselves. You can be right and yet you can damage the other by your behavior. This is when two categories of people arise. One category is of those who think let other suffer, that is not my problem and let me enjoy and take what I can get. These are not bad people and they do also not have any bad intention. There is another category of people who say that I may be right through out but how can I enjoy when so many are suffering! If this category of people were not there, there is no question of higher wisdom. Many other thinkers stopped at this level where they defined what is good and what is bad. What is right and what is wrong in the name of spirituality. If Bhagavad-Gita is addressing this issue then Arjuna to whom Krishna is giving the message would have easily asked this question that whole life he has been good and has never done any thing intentionally or unintentionally also bad. But he is suffering in the battle field with agony which he expressed. On the other hand Duryodhana who has been all through his life has been bad and even when a chance is given to him to be good or even neutral he has been by self commitment bad. That shows the freedom of a human being has the possibility to become good or to become bad. Though there were elders and people of wisdom telling him that he should do otherwise he has continued to be bad. At the war Duryodhana did not suffer with mental agony and he was happy and ready to fight war. Now Arjuna required remedy for his problems and Duryodhana did not require any thing!</span><br/><span>** This gives us several ideas about Gita. One is that, the person who is bad is happy but person whose behavior for whole life was good, he is unhappy. The person who did wicked namely Duryodhana, did not suffer mental agony and good person namely Arjuna appears that he is suffering mental agony!** It is not due to the god deeds and good behavior he suffers but because he is sensitive and this sensitivity is a growth and being insensitive is not growth. Therefore the discussion that goes on in Bhagavad-Gita is not about good and evil but it is about life far beyond right and wrong, good and evil etc. a moralistic life is not the final purpose of life. Moral can be subjected to questioning! If the life is limited to the educating or improving oneself from evil ways of living to good ways of life, it is not sufficient and in order to go from evil to good a spiritual text is not necessary, a moral code of conduct is good. The situation of Bhagavad-Gita shows that the sufferings of life do not stop by being good. We need to go beyond both and this is the higher dimension of life.</span><br/><span>** Bhagavad-Gita is a text which gives this higher dimension of life which is called as Purushartha. With out this Purushartha for human being, self or ‘me’ becomes more important and he will try to work for fulfilling this. *</span><br/><span>* Life or the creation is made up of variety which can be divided into two or more than two aspects, like day and night, good and bad, right and wrong mine and not mine etc. we always go for one and reject the other. The reality of life is that every thing here is short lived. Even our experiences are also short lived. The happiness that we think an object is giving us, is short lived and soon we start experiencing sorrow too. The day will convert slowly into night before you realize. Before we enjoy some one’s birth, a case of death is waiting for us round the corner. When the Upanishad sage says that life is like a droplet of water or the soap bubble, he does not mean that the life is short lived and therefore it is unreal or unimportant! The life becomes all the more important if we know that life is short lived. There is a more powerful logic to take life seriously and indulge more seriously if the life is short lived. Like the flower is short lived where as thorns are for ever. Live flower is short lived where as the plastic flower is there for ever. Therefore the plastic flower is no match for the real flower. The purpose of a sage to say that life is short lived is to indicate that even if you are seeking happiness here it will soon change and will become sorrow. They are only helping us to understand that soon you will loose and what you really do not want will come into your hands. There is no possibility that you can choose one and not have the other! Even if you are having comfort all the time soon you get used to the life of comfort and then the same comfort can not give you any happiness and you are now looking for some thing different and if that some thing different can to be there you will be miserable.</span><br/><span>** Due to ignorance we always try to switch from one object to the other one situation to the other. The whole material world gives us so many alternatives and constant ideas that go for this or that so that it is happy or it is eternal!*</span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><em>presented at a conference NIMHANS</em><br/><em>By Sri NV Raghuram</em><br/><br/><span>-Full Paper-</span><br/><br/><span>* Human being has the freedom which the other species do not have. Freedom does not come with only one side of the coin it has both the good and bad which means human being can improve himself and can destroy himself. That is the reason human being also has a purpose rather responsibility for living. When we say he has responsibility it does not mean in the sense of pressure or burden but like a joyful play. He is not an isolated creature but he is part of the creation and the best part of it therefore he has the responsibility of the other creatures on the earth. This in Vedanta is called as ‘purushartha’, ‘/arthate iti purushah’/. Once this purushartha is understood then one can see that the society around him is for this purushartha the nature around him is for the sake of this purushartha and the whole development we see around can be for the sake of this purushartha.</span><br/><span>** One may raise the question in what way is it different form the concept of good and bad, right and wrong, and sin and virtue. The concept of these pairs of opposites can not take us above the level of selfishness of a human being. Once this selfishness one can use his intelligence to take care of this selfishness and say that why should I care for others, they have to take care of themselves. You can be right and yet you can damage the other by your behavior. This is when two categories of people arise. One category is of those who think let other suffer, that is not my problem and let me enjoy and take what I can get. These are not bad people and they do also not have any bad intention. There is another category of people who say that I may be right through out but how can I enjoy when so many are suffering! If this category of people were not there, there is no question of higher wisdom. Many other thinkers stopped at this level where they defined what is good and what is bad. What is right and what is wrong in the name of spirituality. If Bhagavad-Gita is addressing this issue then Arjuna to whom Krishna is giving the message would have easily asked this question that whole life he has been good and has never done any thing intentionally or unintentionally also bad. But he is suffering in the battle field with agony which he expressed. On the other hand Duryodhana who has been all through his life has been bad and even when a chance is given to him to be good or even neutral he has been by self commitment bad. That shows the freedom of a human being has the possibility to become good or to become bad. Though there were elders and people of wisdom telling him that he should do otherwise he has continued to be bad. At the war Duryodhana did not suffer with mental agony and he was happy and ready to fight war. Now Arjuna required remedy for his problems and Duryodhana did not require any thing!</span><br/><span>** This gives us several ideas about Gita. One is that, the person who is bad is happy but person whose behavior for whole life was good, he is unhappy. The person who did wicked namely Duryodhana, did not suffer mental agony and good person namely Arjuna appears that he is suffering mental agony!** It is not due to the god deeds and good behavior he suffers but because he is sensitive and this sensitivity is a growth and being insensitive is not growth. Therefore the discussion that goes on in Bhagavad-Gita is not about good and evil but it is about life far beyond right and wrong, good and evil etc. a moralistic life is not the final purpose of life. Moral can be subjected to questioning! If the life is limited to the educating or improving oneself from evil ways of living to good ways of life, it is not sufficient and in order to go from evil to good a spiritual text is not necessary, a moral code of conduct is good. The situation of Bhagavad-Gita shows that the sufferings of life do not stop by being good. We need to go beyond both and this is the higher dimension of life.</span><br/><span>** Bhagavad-Gita is a text which gives this higher dimension of life which is called as Purushartha. With out this Purushartha for human being, self or ‘me’ becomes more important and he will try to work for fulfilling this. *</span><br/><span>* Life or the creation is made up of variety which can be divided into two or more than two aspects, like day and night, good and bad, right and wrong mine and not mine etc. we always go for one and reject the other. The reality of life is that every thing here is short lived. Even our experiences are also short lived. The happiness that we think an object is giving us, is short lived and soon we start experiencing sorrow too. The day will convert slowly into night before you realize. Before we enjoy some one’s birth, a case of death is waiting for us round the corner. When the Upanishad sage says that life is like a droplet of water or the soap bubble, he does not mean that the life is short lived and therefore it is unreal or unimportant! The life becomes all the more important if we know that life is short lived. There is a more powerful logic to take life seriously and indulge more seriously if the life is short lived. Like the flower is short lived where as thorns are for ever. Live flower is short lived where as the plastic flower is there for ever. Therefore the plastic flower is no match for the real flower. The purpose of a sage to say that life is short lived is to indicate that even if you are seeking happiness here it will soon change and will become sorrow. They are only helping us to understand that soon you will loose and what you really do not want will come into your hands. There is no possibility that you can choose one and not have the other! Even if you are having comfort all the time soon you get used to the life of comfort and then the same comfort can not give you any happiness and you are now looking for some thing different and if that some thing different can to be there you will be miserable.</span><br/><span>** Due to ignorance we always try to switch from one object to the other one situation to the other.

He first asked Lord that he should not have death. Lord said, &lsquo;that is not possible because in the creation, birth and death are two sides of the same coin. Therefore if we have accepted birth we need to accept death too&rsquo;. Therefore Lord asked him to choose any other boon. At this time Hiranya Kashipu asked for the boon that he can not be killed by man or beast, inside the house or outside, in the day or in the night like that he intelligently thought for relief from all possible pairs of opposite. Lord happily granted. This has leaded him to think that he has tricked Lord because he thought how can there be any thing apart from these opposites. But then the Lord Nrusimha the Lord of Man-beast appeared to him in the 'sandhi&rsquo; or the middle of all, which is middle of day and night middle of house and outside the threshold etc and neither on earth nor in the sky on his lap, the Lord eliminated him without any weapons as lion does not naturally use any weapons.</span><br/><span>Lot of these puranik stories has philosophical significance.</span><br/><span>Pair of opposites is the way intellect always works. For intellect, if one is good the other must be bad. Intellect is based on the world outside. For the intellect only yes or no. There is nothing like the middle way. This is one aspect. the other aspect is best of the material world is gold which is known as Hiranya and one who has covered himself with gold in other words one who is only seeing the material world is known as Hiranya Kashipa. His son is Prahlada, which suggests one who is extremely happy naturally. Father could not understand son how he can be happy without any attachment to money. Another important thing is where there is intellect there is no emotions and the harder the intellect the lesser the relation ship, there is nothing like father and son. Therefore blinded by the intellect Hiranya Kashipa does not see it is his own son who is happy. Due to the ego of intellect the father is now jealousy of his own son&rsquo;s happiness. Son told father that the cause for his happiness is the devotion or surrender to Lord. How can an arrogant person think there can another person who is Lord higher than himself? Especially when he has been successful even to misguide god in getting his boon. He tries to give problems to his son thinking that his son will be frightened and will come round to accept him as the Lord out of fear and there is no other lord who is greater than him. Intellect always compares and wants to be the best. Intellect never thinks of conquering out of love. Hiranya kashipas sister is Holika, who is kind to Prahlada.

That Holika has to go with Gold, so cutting the long story short Holika sacrifices herself for the sake of saving Prahlada. Prahlada is saved from the raging fire due to harmony or Holika. The philosophy behind this story is Harmony is the secret of creation the Lord and not the arrogance of intellect. Lord does not exist in extremities. He is an experience beyond all forms of pairs of opposites. He is the principle of Samanvaya or Harmony. Therefore he eliminated Hiranya Kashipa in the sandhi Kala or the time between day and night, by the form which be in between Man and animal at the entrance of the building neither in nor out side.</span><br/><span>In the context of Hiranya Kashipa who has power and its arrogance and there is no emotions, even son is not important then how can he care for sister Holika. Holika is only a person useful to him for taking care of his interests.</span><br/><span>We must learn a lesson that if we use our sadhana for the sake of power and not for the sake of peace and humility like the way Hiranya Kashipa wasted, the power corrupts us and destroys us. Hiranayna Kashipa was a great spiritual sadhaka but unfortunately his direction has been on Power and not on peace and harmony. A person who sees power can not see God&rsquo;s presence but a person who sees peace finds god every where. That is how the conversation goes on between father and son.</span><br/><span>Father says show me where is your god. Son smiles and says why do you say show me he is every where and there is nothing which is not Him. Father asks can you show me the god in this pillar. Son says, 'when I said every where it also means this pillar too but if you have the eyes to see god, then only you can see him there&rsquo;. Then he prays to god saying show His form in this pillar. At that time all the objects around there were eagerly waiting let the king ask for showing god in them so that they are too eager to manifest god in them. The chance came to Pillar and from there he manifests. Why is it pillar and why not any thing else? It is because pillar also means that which is absolutely stable and which is the support for the whole building. Lord showed therefore he is the support of all the creation by manifesting and eliminating Hiranya Kashipa. Holi therefore indicated a festival of joy for the victory of heart over head.

It was a very amusing incident when you see at it superficially but it also has a very deep philosophical significance.</span><br/><br/><span>One very big Swamiji heading a very important religious sect in India was visiting Bangalore and the whole street he is supposed to pass was completely decorated with mango leaves tied all along the streets and decorated with /kolums/ or /rangolis/ and oil lamps every where, to receive him and the traffic is diverted from that street so that thousands of devotees, followers and scholars and philosophers could go in procession behind the Swamiji. On either side, the ladies dressed in sacred gorgeous silk dresses standing with lighted lamps in their hands. Men in sacred dress were standing, ringing bells to greet Swamiji.</span><br/><br/><span>Amidst chanting of Vedic hymns, sounds of cymbals and the melody of Nadaswaram Swamiji appeared, walking in slow steps receiving the Pranams of the people with his eyes, and in turn showering his blessings with a serene smile.</span><br/><br/><span>One more, important, ritual was anybody who paid an amount of offering of some big money some thing like a five thousand and one rupees or so, will have the privilege to wash his feet. Several ladies were washing his feet with the water specially brought in golden or silver vassal depending upon their status! After washing his feet, they would sprinkle the water from the feet on their heads as a mark of respect and devotion.</span><br/><br/><span>In front of one house, a lady in sacred dress came with a silver pot of water and a silver plate in her hand to wash his holy feet. A small little girl around five year’s age must be the daughter of the lady also came out with a brass (supposed to be equally sacred) pot of water. The organizers stopped her allowed her mother only (obviously, the money paid is only for one person!) The mother tried to convince the organizers but they did not agree. Then the mother left the girl behind at her door steps of the house, and went ahead to wash the feet of the holy man.</span><br/><br/><span>I was standing there seeing all the things happening and now I am curious as to what the girl is going to do! The little girl saw her mother washing the feet of the holy man and sprinkling the water on her head, the little girl looked around and found all the people around were big and busy. Then she quietly bend forward pushed her long skirt to the side and with the pot of water in her hand, she washed her own feet, sprinkled that water on her head and touched the water to her eyes with total devotion. I was filled with immense joy looking at the rare sight!</span><br/><br/><span>I felt in my heart that the tender feet of the innocent girl were much holier and divine compared to the costly feet of the holy man!</span><br/><br/><span>Those are very innocent! Where there is innocence, manipulation is not there. It is priceless! In innocence, ego is not born. When ego is not there, even if you wash your own feet it is washing divine feet only. Where ‘I’ is not there only devotion is there. Washing ones own feet, is like Krishna referring to ‘I’ in Bhagavad-Gita. When Krishna says ‘I’ he is not saying out of ego. It is not like ordinary people saying ‘I’</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna says in Gita, ‘give up all Dharmas and surrender to me. ‘I’ shall liberate you from all sins. This ‘I’ of Krishna is like the innocent ‘I’ or the tender feet of the child.</span><br/><br/><span>Many take it unfortunately literally, and say how egoistic is the statement of Krishna asking Arjuna, who is a trained and courageous warrior, to surrender just because he came to him for advice and words of wisdom to clarify his confusion. Why should Krishna ask him to surrender and be a slave! Arjuna is not a kid, who does not understand. Why should he not try to convince logically? This is how some take stand. It appears like Krishna is not using intellect but is playing emotional trick.</span><br/><br/><span>Some others take the sentence literally and try to propagate the idea that Krishna is the only lord and therefore he said so. Krishna is the only lord and neither Rama nor Shiva nor any other god assured anybody any time but Krishna did and he did give salvation. You can do any amount of sins he will clean all that up and makes you fresh! This is another type of fanatics!</span><br/><br/><span>When you are looking at them logically these arguments, appear right and convincing!</span><br/><br/><span>First of all, let us see, whether we can limit our understanding to logic and science only or do we have a reason to go beyond!</span><br/><br/><span>Science lives on logic and develops on logic and it appears very convincing because you see it is man’s logic, which has developed all this science. Thinkers like Aristotle said, man is a thinking or rational animal. In other words, animals have no rational mind but man has. It is only this rational mind identifies man over animals. But with the technology development, we are in a difficult situation. With the birth of computers, man has invented machines which can think like man. In fact, the present computers, both in speed and volume, can handle thinking much better than human being. Many times human being may falter but computers do not. They also can not afford to make mistakes. The computers have greater facility to think than human being. If only thinking is the criteria for superiority of human being over other things as Aristotle mentioned, lifeless computers prove better than human beings.</span><br/><br/><span>We need to understand thinking little more deeply. We have hands and legs as our instruments and we have invented substitute implements to take care of them. These implements are much better than the hands and legs. Similarly, we have an instrument which thinks and we have invented substitute implements which can do their function. That is called as computer.</span><br/><br/><span>This only proves the process called thinking does not belong to consciousness. It belongs to an implement or an instrument. It is a mechanical process and consciousness is not mechanical, matter is mechanical. Logic belongs to mind and brain. Superior to logic and thinking we have another activity going on within which is ‘feeling’. Machine does not feel but man feels. The feeling that I am limited, this belongs to me, this I feel no good all such things only man can feel and no machine can feel. This forms ego of man too and we are familiar with this ego. Ego limits us and isolates us from the rest of the creation.</span><br/><br/><span>We are so familiar with this ego. Therefore, even when Krishna says, surrender to ‘me’; we look at with an idea of limited ego. We start questioning as how can a person like Krishna who gave such an extra ordinary message talk from the platform of ego. There are two reasons for this question to rise.</span><br/><br/><span>The whole training in this world is to give importance to ‘me and mine’ which is this limited and limiting ego. We tend to look at every thing with this limited ego. Limiting is putting boundary and is called as ego. When there is no boundary, we feel insecure. We feel highly insecure if we do not see it with the view of ego.</span><br/><br/><span>The second reason is our ego exists based on material world which is again derived from our senses. Even if we are thinking of the sun which has so much power or the galaxies or Milky Way that contains so many stars and expand to so many light years etc, the knowledge of them all belongs to thinking which is again based on senses and their mathematics. This knowledge is also our ego. More and more knowledge becomes further decoration of our ego. Though the magnitude of these objects may humble us for a second the knowledge of these objects will become our ego and we feel we are grater than all of them.</span><br/><br/><span>Apart from this knowledge, there is another aspect with in us, which is feeling and it appears to be much closer to us than the knowledge. Feelings are of two types one is gross like the feeling of hot and cold, and the other is subtle that feel god’s presence, a feeling of compassion for the animals, feeling of wonder, etc.</span><br/><br/><span>One fear the intellectual always has, is that if it does not fit in logic or thinking then it becomes a myth and it goes far away from reality. It is then a blind faith.</span><br/><br/><span>Vedanta holds the view that even to think that every thing has to be explained by intellect or logic itself is a blind faith. There are several experiences, which are spontaneous and which are not bound by the senses but the moment you have them all our impressions change. We feel elevated. But if you bring in intellect the whole experience is lost, the whole innocence is lost. The spontaneity is not there any more.</span><br/><br/><span>A similar experience is given in the case of Janaka.</span><br/><br/><span>In the second chapter of ‘Astavakra geeta’, Janaka, the king of Mithila,says, “Oh I am wonderful I bow to me out of full respect. This sentence, he repeats several times. Each time wondering at one or the other aspect and the aspect is not logical and not related to any particular sense organ.</span><br/><br/><span>Aho, aham namo myaham, … oh I am wonderful and I bow at my feet…</span><br/><br/><span>Spirituality is experience and not logic. Logic can not even be a shadow of spirituality like a live experience. Same way god is an experience which only a person who can go beyond logic can have!</span><br/><br/><span>Aristotle said, man is a thinking animal, but we need to change this statement today after all this technological development. Man’s growth is in the experience is much profounder than the thinking. It reaches in to all his pores of the body all his cells of the body. Even a simple experience like you tasted ice cream you whole body feels the coolness. You take liquor; it reaches every part of your body, immediately your legs show your eyes show the influence of the liquor. Your talk can not hide the influence. Karl Marx said spirituality is like intoxication. He is true because spirituality is an experience and not just intellectual. in spirituality unlike in inteelctual every cell willl be filled with expereince!</span><br/><br/><span>For Krishna the expression of ‘me’ or ‘my’ is only symbolic and nothing more than that. No ego is attached in that. This ‘me’ is the expression of god it is not solid ‘my’ like our ‘my’. But we take the symbolic ‘my’ very seriously like the flag of the nation which is nothing but the symbol. If one spits on the land of the nation, nobody bothers but if one spits on the flag there will be total violence. You go to the best of government offices you see every where the marks of the spitting in every corner.</span><br/><br/><span>If you look into Krishna, there is no ‘I’ at all. How can there be ego. How can you think that Krishna would have ego. Before the war, when there was a need for a messenger to negotiate with Kauravas, he went without any hesitation or any ego, that he is so great.</span><br/><br/><span>A very sweet incident happened in the life of Sri Ramakrishna. When the person who took the photo of Sri Ramakrishna in sitting posture, which is now the main picture, being worshipped in the Ramakrishna maths, he started offering his Pranams again and again and started saying how wonderful and how spiritual it is! Some one then pointed to him, “Thakur, what are you doing; why are you bowing to you it is your picture”. Thakur very innocently replied, “where is my picture, I am not offering my respects to the person in the picture I am seeing the Samadhi and I am offering my prayers to this Samadhi and not the person”!</span><br/><br/><span>We are all Brahman the divinity when we are not there in other words our ego is not there. That is the real state of Samadhi and that is the state of every child. With spiritual Sadhana, we have to become once again child like. That is the reason Jesus said in bible only a child like can reach the kingdom of god!</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Don’t get terrified looking at the heavy Vedantic title of this writing.It is only to share and explain about an incident I remember from past.When I was reading the Astavakra gita where King Janaka says, “Oh I am wonderful, and I bow at my feet”, I recollect from my memory, an incident that I, happened to witness several years ago. It was a very amusing incident when you see at it superficially but it also has a very deep philosophical significance.</span><br/><br/><span>One very big Swamiji heading a very important religious sect in India was visiting Bangalore and the whole street he is supposed to pass was completely decorated with mango leaves tied all along the streets and decorated with /kolums/ or /rangolis/ and oil lamps every where, to receive him and the traffic is diverted from that street so that thousands of devotees, followers and scholars and philosophers could go in procession behind the Swamiji. On either side, the ladies dressed in sacred gorgeous silk dresses standing with lighted lamps in their hands. Men in sacred dress were standing, ringing bells to greet Swamiji.</span><br/><br/><span>Amidst chanting of Vedic hymns, sounds of cymbals and the melody of Nadaswaram Swamiji appeared, walking in slow steps receiving the Pranams of the people with his eyes, and in turn showering his blessings with a serene smile.</span><br/><br/><span>One more, important, ritual was anybody who paid an amount of offering of some big money some thing like a five thousand and one rupees or so, will have the privilege to wash his feet. Several ladies were washing his feet with the water specially brought in golden or silver vassal depending upon their status! After washing his feet, they would sprinkle the water from the feet on their heads as a mark of respect and devotion.</span><br/><br/><span>In front of one house, a lady in sacred dress came with a silver pot of water and a silver plate in her hand to wash his holy feet. A small little girl around five year’s age must be the daughter of the lady also came out with a brass (supposed to be equally sacred) pot of water. The organizers stopped her allowed her mother only (obviously, the money paid is only for one person!) The mother tried to convince the organizers but they did not agree. Then the mother left the girl behind at her door steps of the house, and went ahead to wash the feet of the holy man.</span><br/><br/><span>I was standing there seeing all the things happening and now I am curious as to what the girl is going to do! The little girl saw her mother washing the feet of the holy man and sprinkling the water on her head, the little girl looked around and found all the people around were big and busy. Then she quietly bend forward pushed her long skirt to the side and with the pot of water in her hand, she washed her own feet, sprinkled that water on her head and touched the water to her eyes with total devotion. I was filled with immense joy looking at the rare sight!</span><br/><br/><span>I felt in my heart that the tender feet of the innocent girl were much holier and divine compared to the costly feet of the holy man!</span><br/><br/><span>Those are very innocent! Where there is innocence, manipulation is not there. It is priceless! In innocence, ego is not born. When ego is not there, even if you wash your own feet it is washing divine feet only. Where ‘I’ is not there only devotion is there. Washing ones own feet, is like Krishna referring to ‘I’ in Bhagavad-Gita. When Krishna says ‘I’ he is not saying out of ego. It is not like ordinary people saying ‘I’</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna says in Gita, ‘give up all Dharmas and surrender to me. ‘I’ shall liberate you from all sins. This ‘I’ of Krishna is like the innocent ‘I’ or the tender feet of the child.</span><br/><br/><span>Many take it unfortunately literally, and say how egoistic is the statement of Krishna asking Arjuna, who is a trained and courageous warrior, to surrender just because he came to him for advice and words of wisdom to clarify his confusion. Why should Krishna ask him to surrender and be a slave! Arjuna is not a kid, who does not understand. Why should he not try to convince logically? This is how some take stand. It appears like Krishna is not using intellect but is playing emotional trick.</span><br/><br/><span>Some others take the sentence literally and try to propagate the idea that Krishna is the only lord and therefore he said so. Krishna is the only lord and neither Rama nor Shiva nor any other god assured anybody any time but Krishna did and he did give salvation. You can do any amount of sins he will clean all that up and makes you fresh! This is another type of fanatics!</span><br/><br/><span>When you are looking at them logically these arguments, appear right and convincing!</span><br/><br/><span>First of all, let us see, whether we can limit our understanding to logic and science only or do we have a reason to go beyond!</span><br/><br/><span>Science lives on logic and develops on logic and it appears very convincing because you see it is man’s logic, which has developed all this science. Thinkers like Aristotle said, man is a thinking or rational animal. In other words, animals have no rational mind but man has. It is only this rational mind identifies man over animals. But with the technology development, we are in a difficult situation. With the birth of computers, man has invented machines which can think like man. In fact, the present computers, both in speed and volume, can handle thinking much better than human being. Many times human being may falter but computers do not. They also can not afford to make mistakes. The computers have greater facility to think than human being. If only thinking is the criteria for superiority of human being over other things as Aristotle mentioned, lifeless computers prove better than human beings.</span><br/><br/><span>We need to understand thinking little more deeply. We have hands and legs as our instruments and we have invented substitute implements to take care of them. These implements are much better than the hands and legs. Similarly, we have an instrument which thinks and we have invented substitute implements which can do their function. That is called as computer.</span><br/><br/><span>This only proves the process called thinking does not belong to consciousness. It belongs to an implement or an instrument. It is a mechanical process and consciousness is not mechanical, matter is mechanical. Logic belongs to mind and brain. Superior to logic and thinking we have another activity going on within which is ‘feeling’. Machine does not feel but man feels. The feeling that I am limited, this belongs to me, this I feel no good all such things only man can feel and no machine can feel. This forms ego of man too and we are familiar with this ego. Ego limits us and isolates us from the rest of the creation.</span><br/><br/><span>We are so familiar with this ego. Therefore, even when Krishna says, surrender to ‘me’; we look at with an idea of limited ego. We start questioning as how can a person like Krishna who gave such an extra ordinary message talk from the platform of ego. There are two reasons for this question to rise.</span><br/><br/><span>The whole training in this world is to give importance to ‘me and mine’ which is this limited and limiting ego. We tend to look at every thing with this limited ego. Limiting is putting boundary and is called as ego. When there is no boundary, we feel insecure. We feel highly insecure if we do not see it with the view of ego.</span><br/><br/><span>The second reason is our ego exists based on material world which is again derived from our senses. Even if we are thinking of the sun which has so much power or the galaxies or Milky Way that contains so many stars and expand to so many light years etc, the knowledge of them all belongs to thinking which is again based on senses and their mathematics. This knowledge is also our ego. More and more knowledge becomes further decoration of our ego. Though the magnitude of these objects may humble us for a second the knowledge of these objects will become our ego and we feel we are grater than all of them.</span><br/><br/><span>Apart from this knowledge, there is another aspect with in us, which is feeling and it appears to be much closer to us than the knowledge. Feelings are of two types one is gross like the feeling of hot and cold, and the other is subtle that feel god’s presence, a feeling of compassion for the animals, feeling of wonder, etc.</span><br/><br/><span>One fear the intellectual always has, is that if it does not fit in logic or thinking then it becomes a myth and it goes far away from reality.

There is a great significance to ghee. It is a product of milk. When you pour milk onto a fire, even if there is ghee in it, the fire will die. The milk has to go through an entire process; the first step is to boil the milk and cool to a suitable temperature. Then the milk is curdled and must pass through the whole process of churning to become butter. The butter is then simmered in low heat with a lot of patience and then the ghee will be separated from the rest of the butter milk. After the processing of the milk, the ghee assists in increasing the strength of the fire while also decreasing the amount of smoke. </span><br/><br/><span>The example of the Ghee is analogous to our Vasanas and Samskaras or tendencies or bondages. Like milk, we are unprocessed and raw. We are not useful to kindle the fire within; we cannot even recognize the fire, or Brahman within. In order to merge into Brahman we must remove our tendencies of attachment, likes and dislikes. We need to go through the Tapasya. The ‘tapas’ are symbolically presented in stages. The first stage to make ghee is boiling milk; similarly we need to go through the deep urge for the journey of spirituality. Then we need to shift our environment and priorities. This is followed by churning which symbolizes the discipline such as yoga and other practices. Then the product of these stages will be heated on the fire to remove the remaining dirt; this is the final dissolving of the ego. Once we purify ourselves with this purification process that comes from within, we are fit to be an offering to Brahman. </span><br/><br/><span>In our journey of spiritual growth, we attempt to initially give up our likes and dislikes. For example, when we eat, we discontinue eating to satisfy our desires and instead, we feed only our hunger. Maintaining this awareness helps us refrain from abusing our body through food and allows us to eat in harmony with our hunger and thus, our body. By remaining in harmony with our body we do not eat in excess nor do we under-eat; this is Yagna, otherwise we are violent to our bodies. </span><br/><br/><span>I was watching the animal channel on television one day. There was a tiger resting comfortably after just having eaten. Directly in front of the tiger was a deer grazing in the grass, oblivious to the tiger. Having heard the sound of the deer, the tiger raised his head and looked at the deer. The deer then noticed the tiger and looked at him with suspicion. Usually the deer would be food for the lion, but now since his stomach is full, the tiger just yawned and went back to resting without harming the deer. The deer also continued to graze. The commentator made a point worth noting; he said the tigers are not violent; they eat food when they are hungry. This is an example of how eating food when you are not hungry is violence, and this violence is not against anyone but against your own body. Our body totally depends on us, and if we abuse it, who else can save it? Both, under feeding and over feeding harms our body and this can be avoided only if we are aware that eating is not to fulfill our desires and ego, but it is Brahma Karma. Thus, let us make it a point to recite this mantra before every meal to remind ourselves of Brahma Karma. The concept of Brahman and the discipline that we should not be violent against our body does not belong to any religion, thus this mantra does not belong to any religion per se, it belongs to mankind.</span><br/><br/><span>Love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>The ghee is also Brahman; it is identified as self.

After the processing of the milk, the ghee assists in increasing the strength of the fire while also decreasing the amount of smoke. </span><br/><br/><span>The example of the Ghee is analogous to our Vasanas and Samskaras or tendencies or bondages. Like milk, we are unprocessed and raw. We are not useful to kindle the fire within; we cannot even recognize the fire, or Brahman within. In order to merge into Brahman we must remove our tendencies of attachment, likes and dislikes. We need to go through the Tapasya. The ‘tapas’ are symbolically presented in stages. The first stage to make ghee is boiling milk; similarly we need to go through the deep urge for the journey of spirituality. Then we need to shift our environment and priorities. This is followed by churning which symbolizes the discipline such as yoga and other practices. Then the product of these stages will be heated on the fire to remove the remaining dirt; this is the final dissolving of the ego. Once we purify ourselves with this purification process that comes from within, we are fit to be an offering to Brahman. </span><br/><br/><span>In our journey of spiritual growth, we attempt to initially give up our likes and dislikes. For example, when we eat, we discontinue eating to satisfy our desires and instead, we feed only our hunger. Maintaining this awareness helps us refrain from abusing our body through food and allows us to eat in harmony with our hunger and thus, our body. By remaining in harmony with our body we do not eat in excess nor do we under-eat; this is Yagna, otherwise we are violent to our bodies. </span><br/><br/><span>I was watching the animal channel on television one day. There was a tiger resting comfortably after just having eaten. Directly in front of the tiger was a deer grazing in the grass, oblivious to the tiger. Having heard the sound of the deer, the tiger raised his head and looked at the deer. The deer then noticed the tiger and looked at him with suspicion. Usually the deer would be food for the lion, but now since his stomach is full, the tiger just yawned and went back to resting without harming the deer. The deer also continued to graze. The commentator made a point worth noting; he said the tigers are not violent; they eat food when they are hungry. This is an example of how eating food when you are not hungry is violence, and this violence is not against anyone but against your own body. Our body totally depends on us, and if we abuse it, who else can save it? Both, under feeding and over feeding harms our body and this can be avoided only if we are aware that eating is not to fulfill our desires and ego, but it is Brahma Karma. Thus, let us make it a point to recite this mantra before every meal to remind ourselves of Brahma Karma. The concept of Brahman and the discipline that we should not be violent against our body does not belong to any religion, thus this mantra does not belong to any religion per se, it belongs to mankind.</span><br/><br/><span>Love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"The meaning of \"Bramarpanam\" Mantra - 3","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-06-08T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-06-08T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-06-08T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":127,"uuid":"9984e082-53b5-4181-9759-cfda782f85c2","title":"Finding Inner Peace: Yoga Techniques (2)","slug":"finding-inner-peace-yoga-techniques-2","markdown":"<p><span>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</span><br/><span>Raghuramji&rsquo;s Japan tour program started.

Shuka is a youth who was involved in the regular life of gossiping and playing. One day, his father, Vyasa called him and said, “Now you are 14 and grown up so you need to develop responsibility and learn knowledge.” The son asked what for? The father replied that we should all study scriptures so that we do spiritual Sadhana. Through this we will come to know that our nature is bliss and we are not the body and all things attached to it.” </span><br/><br/><span>Shuka asked his father, “What did you say? My nature is bliss and I am not this body and its attachments?” His father replied with a simple, “Yes.” So the son further questioned, “How do we know this?” The father replied, “We know that we are free with no mother, no father, no birth, and no death. We know this through introspection, or an inner journey.” </span><br/><br/><span>Shuka, talking to himself, said, “is that so….” And he started walking as if he was nobody. When the father looked at the sudden transformation of his son, he did not take it too seriously immediately. But he quickly realized that something happened to his son. He could not believe the effect of his words on his son! He followed his son asking him, “My son, what has happened to you? Why are you going? Where are you going?” But Shuka transformed the minute he heard that he has no father or mother, because he is not the body but the soul. The Soul does not take birth nor does it die; it has nowhere to go but is everywhere; and he is peace himself because the Soul is peace.</span><br/><br/><span>Shuka kept walking and the father was following and shouting behind him, “Oh my son, where are you going? Talk to me, dear son.” But there is no son; he has already dissolved. There is no longer, Shuka, the son of Vyasa. There is only a soul in the form of Shuka; he has lost even the identity with his name so he does not respond.</span><br/><br/><span>As Shuka kept walking, he began passing through a place where there was a pond meant for the ladies of the village to bathe and play. Since it is exclusively for ladies, no male members are permitted to go there. They did not mind running around the pond without caring about being covered or not. </span><br/><br/><span>Shuka passed that way and they did not care that a youthful man went by. However when his father ran behind him, shouting, “My dear son!&hellip;,” the women ran into the water of the pond to cover their modesty. Vyasa was surprised at their reaction on that occasion and could not contain his curiosity. He asked them why they did not mind when Shuka, a young man came through. But when he, being over 70 years old and like a grandfather, came through, they covered themselves. They replied to him, “Shuka was like a child who does not have any attachment with his body so there is no feeling of a man’s presences and in his passing we could feel the presence of a pure soul. They further added, “Where as the very fact that you are shouting and saying ‘my son, my son’ we can see how much attachment you have with the body, because the son belongs to the body as he is born to the body.” Only body attachment brings about the sex consciousness that is the reason they have to hide their bodies. Soul with attachment looses its purity whereas a person like Shuka is so pure in his heart that all it required was for him to hear once that he is a pure soul and he is at peace for him to internalize and establish his own peace.

This circular connection can be witnessed in nature when exploring water. Ocean water vaporizes into steam; this steam takes the form of clouds which condense and become rain; the rain becomes ice on mountain peaks which melt and become water; this water flows down a river and joins the ocean. This cycle continues. As water moves through this cycle, in its true sense the water is not different but takes various forms and gives us crops in the fields and turns into the Ganga river and other such sacred places. The changing forms of water bring to life flowing reality. Life is a combination of several such cycles and all of these cycles are part of one big cycle which we call “Brahman.” Brahman defined literally means ‘that which encompasses everything.’ Brahma- Karma is activity as a whole. The work is Brahman, the perceiver is Brahman, and the act of perception is also Brahman.</span><br/><br/><span>It is easy to logically understand the idea that everything is Brahman; however, there is a great gap between the knowledge of Brahman and the experience of Brahman. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna’s emphasis is not on the logical understanding, but more importantly, on the experience of becoming. The one facet that separates our understanding from experience is a thin wall within called ‘I.’ we hold on to this ‘I,’ thus we remain separated from the experience. Everything we are becomes our ego, and everything we do can also become our ego. If we do things for the purpose of strengthening this ego, then our actions will not be useful. Even the concept of ‘I see Brahman in everything’ can be attained to strengthen our ego. The idea that we say this is Brahman and that is Brahman and performing japa in this way will not make us realize that everything is Brahman. Realizing that all is Brahman does not progress in this way. It is not by sitting in front of a tree and repeating ‘This tree is Brahman’ that you will truly see the tree as Brahman because the ‘I am’ in the thought that ‘I am perceiving this tree to be Brahman’, is always the achievement. As long as I am looking at something as an achievement, something is lost and something is gained. There is not much difference between gaining and loosing; they are both part of the same duality. Without our knowledge, this duality further manifests in the form of Brahman and Abrahman, or God and the creation, or divine and devil. They are not two different things. In fact, even if we say that deep inside when we truly reflect, we find the Brahman in this world, and then we are acknowledging that there is a tree and somewhere hidden deep inside there is Brahman which is invisible to others, but I can see it. This is not the experience; the experience is that there is no such thing as the tree and Brahman. However, this concept of Brahman does not apply only to objects. Many people perceive Brahman to be person-like; thus, Krishna begins this sutra with the process of seeing, stating that even the process of seeing is also nothing but Brahman and this is Brahma Karma.</span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em><br/><br/><span>Love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><em>Aum Bramarpanam brahma havih<br/>Brahmagnau brahmanaahutam<br/>Brahmaivatena gantavyam<br/>Brahmakarma Samdhinaa<br/>Aum Shanti Shanti Shantih<br/>- Bhagavat Gita Chapter 4, slk 24</em><br/><br/><span>All of creation is a single, circular entity.

Life is a combination of several such cycles and all of these cycles are part of one big cycle which we call “Brahman.” Brahman defined literally means ‘that which encompasses everything.’ Brahma- Karma is activity as a whole. The work is Brahman, the perceiver is Brahman, and the act of perception is also Brahman.</span><br/><br/><span>It is easy to logically understand the idea that everything is Brahman; however, there is a great gap between the knowledge of Brahman and the experience of Brahman. In the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna’s emphasis is not on the logical understanding, but more importantly, on the experience of becoming. The one facet that separates our understanding from experience is a thin wall within called ‘I.’ we hold on to this ‘I,’ thus we remain separated from the experience. Everything we are becomes our ego, and everything we do can also become our ego. If we do things for the purpose of strengthening this ego, then our actions will not be useful. Even the concept of ‘I see Brahman in everything’ can be attained to strengthen our ego. The idea that we say this is Brahman and that is Brahman and performing japa in this way will not make us realize that everything is Brahman. Realizing that all is Brahman does not progress in this way. It is not by sitting in front of a tree and repeating ‘This tree is Brahman’ that you will truly see the tree as Brahman because the ‘I am’ in the thought that ‘I am perceiving this tree to be Brahman’, is always the achievement. As long as I am looking at something as an achievement, something is lost and something is gained. There is not much difference between gaining and loosing; they are both part of the same duality. Without our knowledge, this duality further manifests in the form of Brahman and Abrahman, or God and the creation, or divine and devil. They are not two different things. In fact, even if we say that deep inside when we truly reflect, we find the Brahman in this world, and then we are acknowledging that there is a tree and somewhere hidden deep inside there is Brahman which is invisible to others, but I can see it. This is not the experience; the experience is that there is no such thing as the tree and Brahman. However, this concept of Brahman does not apply only to objects. Many people perceive Brahman to be person-like; thus, Krishna begins this sutra with the process of seeing, stating that even the process of seeing is also nothing but Brahman and this is Brahma Karma.</span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em><br/><br/><span>Love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"The meaning of \"Bramarpanam\" Mantra - 1","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-05-31T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-05-31T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-05-31T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":99,"uuid":"417a1d53-2404-43b2-bb37-a738090ef032","title":"Amritanshuram's wedding","slug":"amritanshurams-wedding","markdown":"<p><span>My dear Friends </span><br/><span>This is to cordially invite you for the wedding of my son Amritanshuram </span><br/><span>love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram </span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Rlqw5wBLrQI/AAAAAAAAAK0/VQS4YKi9-K8/s1600-h/amritram.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5069558836747808002\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Rlqw5wBLrQI/AAAAAAAAAK0/VQS4YKi9-K8/s320/amritram.JPG\"/></a></p>","html":"<p><span>My dear Friends </span><br/><span>This is to cordially invite you for the wedding of my son Amritanshuram </span><br/><span>love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram </span><br/><br/><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Rlqw5wBLrQI/AAAAAAAAAK0/VQS4YKi9-K8/s1600-h/amritram.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5069558836747808002\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2YnMzVa2pzs/Rlqw5wBLrQI/AAAAAAAAAK0/VQS4YKi9-K8/s320/amritram.JPG\"/></a></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Amritanshuram's wedding","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-05-28T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-05-28T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-05-28T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":100,"uuid":"21f1b692-737e-47dc-b015-fed105f8b9eb","title":"“Sanatan Dharma” Yoga Retreat - 2007","slug":"sanatan-dharma-yoga-retreat-2007","markdown":"<p><span>Yoga Bharati is pleased to announce a three days ‘Yoga Retreat’ with Discourse Series by Shri Raghuramji on the topic ‘Sanatan Dharma’.</span><br/><br/><span>For many years Shri Raghuramji has been visiting USA to bless us with his knowledge and insight of ‘Science of Yoga’.

The exercise has to be done in such a way that we enjoy it and perform it smoothly. Exercises alone are not sufficient for efficient way of being. We also need to effectively and adequately relax We should do practices which will take us to a deeper level of relaxation than sleep, or any other unconscious methods of relaxation, can give us. This is where yoga plays a great role since yoga is the only known technique which can give us such deep relaxation which normally known sleep or external – agents – based – relaxation techiniques.</span><br/><span>Some of the exercises recommended are:</span><br/><span>1. Walking for 30 min – 1 hour, daily.</span><br/><span>2. Walking up and down the staircase for at least twenty steps.</span><br/><span>3. Sitting on the floor using our joints.</span><br/><span>4. Hands stretch and hands in and out breathing exercises.</span><br/><span>5. Some exercises for strengthening the back or spinal cord. </span><br/><span>6. A set of three Suryanamaskaras or Sun salutations </span><br/><br/><span>All these things can be performed for half hour </span><br/><br/><span>The regiment of yoga positions such as asanas generally recommended is:</span><br/><span>a. Standing poses such as ardha kati chakrasana, pada hastasana, ardha chakrasana, trikonasana and parivrutta trikonasana etc</span><br/><span>b. Sitting poses such as paschimatanasana, ustrasana ardha matsendrasana, etc</span><br/><span>c. Supine postures such as viparita karni, sarvangasana, halasana etc</span><br/><span>d. Prone poses such as bhujangasana shalabhasana, dhanurasana.</span><br/><span>e. All the asanas have to be followed at the end or when ever one feels necessary a long Shavasana, DRT or the corpse pose.</span><br/><br/><em>-to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Pancha kosha 7 - Basics of Yoga Therapy","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-05-13T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-05-13T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-05-13T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":104,"uuid":"f2698b77-50ae-4769-93ba-65c79f985c68","title":"An extraordinary newspaper clip","slug":"an-extraordinary-newspaper-clip","markdown":"http://tmblr.co/ZtcNTvKqaiVq","html":"<p><a href=\"http://tmblr.co/ZtcNTvKqaiVq\">http://tmblr.co/ZtcNTvKqaiVq</a></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"An extraordinary newspaper clip","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2007-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2007-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2007-05-08T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":105,"uuid":"76726336-7ea8-408d-bf3c-7640e384901d","title":"Yoga Bharati Retreat - Discourse Series on \"Sanatan Dharma\" / Aug 31-Sept 3, 2007","slug":"yoga-bharati-retreat-discourse-series-on-sanatan-dharma-aug-31-sept-3-2007","markdown":"<p><span>Yoga Bharati is pleased to announce a three days ‘Yoga Retreat’ with Discourse Series by </span><strong>Shri Raghuramji </strong><span>on the topic ‘Sanatan Dharma’.</span><br/><span>For many years Shri Raghuramji has been visiting USA to bless us with his knowledge and insight of ‘Science of Yoga’.

Like you have an adhikara to work as doctor but you do not get any payment no law says it is ok. in fact Krishna specially mentions that no adhikara for phala which means what the Karma supposed to give us as returns or even the benefits. therefore Krishna is saying you have an adhikara to do the activity but not for the phala has to be looked at from different angle. Imagine the amount of contribution and role of the society in your becoming a doctor or engineer.the education is supported by the society in the form of charity they give for education.

Hence, present day medicine is based on symptoms. The patient is referred to specialists based on the area of the body affected. If the sickness is found to manifest in the heart, the patient is sent to a cardiologist, and if it manifests at skin he is referred to dermatologist etc. Whereas, the ancient texts have divided sickness, not into categories based on symptoms, but rather on the cause of sickness.

Vasista says to Rama that it is the disturbances at the subtle level that percolate into the gross level. For example, when we are angry, we can see the blood rushing up to the face and flushing our face red. When we are anxious over something, we immediately notice our heart beating faster. Or when we feel sorrow, we see tears filling the eyes. How does this happen? Whenever such disharmony occurs at the psychological level, it percolates onto the physical level through an imbalance in Prana. Prana is the inner movement. This movement has two different characteristics: rhythmic and speed. Prana that is rhythmic and slow is natural. Prana that is arrhythmic is not natural and is an imbalance. This Prana imbalance precipitates onto body level creating ajeernatvam, kujeernatvam and atijeernatvam. In simple English, this translates to indigestion, wrong digestion and over digestion. Usually when we consider digestion, we think only of food, but in this context digestion is not limited only to the food we eat but to everything that we do: the exercise we perform, the knowledge that we gain, the sleep that we experience, and the experiences that we encounter in our daily life. All of these things are referred to as food in the Vedanta and thus we must properly digest all of these things in order to stay healthy. If we do not, then any or all of them can cause illness and problems resulting in symptoms of sickness in our life. In such cases, the cause for the sickness is the deep rooted imbalances which have percolated within and these imbalances are referred to as ‘adhi.’ Such ailments that originate from adhi are called ‘adhi+ja’= adhija diseases. In Sanskrit we have similar expressions – born out of lotus is padma (lotus) + ja, born to mountain is giri + ja etc. On the other hand, there are certain other diseases where the cause for the sickness is external. Such sicknesses are called ‘na+adhi+ja’= anaadhija or not being caused by internal disturbances. They are sicknesses where the cause is external such as an injury or external abuse of the body such as eating too much sweets or improper food consumption. When the cause is external, the solution can lie at the external level, but when the cause is internal, the remedy is also internal where deep inner harmony must be created. Another side effect of internal sicknesses is that they can make our systems weak and vulnerable, causing additional external disturbances and illnesses. Again the remedy of inner harmony improves our inner stamina and tolerance, allowing us to overcome the unwanted external influence. </span><br/><br/><em>- to be continued&hellip;</em></p>","html":"<p><strong>ADHI AND VYADHI</strong><br/><br/><span>We notice physical sickness when it manifests itself in the form of symptoms.

We all know that we can easily overcome our habits by working on consciously reversing the habit for a certain period of time. This is what we do in case of de -addiction programs. Even every child would have picked up some habit or the other in growing period for few days. But being tutored by the parents or teachers that that habit is bad the child consciously comes out of it by working for a short period of time. One of such common habit is biting the nails and soon the child gives up consciously. If habits can be reversed by consciously working to reverse it, we can similarly reverse the Vasanas and samskaras. Only the difference is that it will take a longer and more arduous process. Thus, we can reverse all problems of disharmony by working to reverse them consciously. The altered conditions like tension at physical level speed at the level of Prana and restlessness at mind level can also percolate and do percolate in us to become Vasanas and samskaras. If tension at a physical level is our Vasana or samskara, we can consciously practice relaxation techniques for a longer period of time. In the same way, we can practice calmness of mind at the mental level and we can consciously overcome our fixations at intellectual level so that we can easily come out of our disharmony at various levels and develop harmony. Harmony is the health; harmony is strength and stamina; and, ultimately, harmony is freedom from suffering, not only in human being but in the whole creation.</span><br/><span>Therefore we need to consciously relax at the physical level to be free from the disturbance but some times our physical condition may limit us from doing certain practices of asanas. For example a person with problem of back pain will not be able to do front bending or back bending with ease and comfort. Therefore, depending on one’s current physical conditions, one must design a practice of physical and relaxation techniques to develop awareness and relaxation. To relax means to be able to leave the body aside and transcend to a subtler level called Prana. With the practice of proper Pranayama techniques one can make the flow of Prana smooth and free from all disturbances and one can make it slow. In turn one can transcend the Prana levels. Here also there are certain techniques some persons need to avoid because of their health conditions. Transcending the pranamaya level takes us to subtler level called mind and by calming the mind one can become harmonious at that level and will be able to reach subtler levels so that finally one can be one with the Ananda level. This is the scheme of yoga therapy. A state of attachment shows the sign of sickness where as a facility for transcending is the sign of freedom or health. In fact this can easily be observed in the case of children. When they are healthy, children are not at Annamaya level or attached to body. Only when they are sick, they are at body level. For example, Mother often says about her child, who is sticking to or clinging to the mother, ‘She normally plays on her own and does not bother me at all, but now since she is sick, she is sticking to me.’ This indicates the reason for attachment is sickness and the manifestation of attachment is sickness.

Thus, we go through a certain amount of disturbances that are personified in our moods. These things individually and collectively leave a certain degree of disharmony. In addition, our own expectations and greed create even more disharmony. According to the philosophy of yoga, this disharmony, if at the incident level, will disappear, similar to the way a child wants something and then cries a bit when he doesn’t get it, but soon forgets about it and moves on. However, we are not like that. We get caught up. Disharmony becomes deeply set in us and takes the shape of habit, much like how our anxiety may manifest in the form of smoking for temporary relief and soon becomes a habit. When we do not remove this at the habit level, it becomes Vasana. At habit level it has not percolated into our pathology.</span><br/><span>When it becomes Vasana, it becomes pathological. For example, when smoking has percolated into a deeper level than a mere habit and the lack of a cigarette actually manifests itself as a headache or other such physical ailment.

Thus, we go through a certain amount of disturbances that are personified in our moods. These things individually and collectively leave a certain degree of disharmony. In addition, our own expectations and greed create even more disharmony. According to the philosophy of yoga, this disharmony, if at the incident level, will disappear, similar to the way a child wants something and then cries a bit when he doesn’t get it, but soon forgets about it and moves on. However, we are not like that. We get caught up. Disharmony becomes deeply set in us and takes the shape of habit, much like how our anxiety may manifest in the form of smoking for temporary relief and soon becomes a habit. When we do not remove this at the habit level, it becomes Vasana. At habit level it has not percolated into our pathology.</span><br/><span>When it becomes Vasana, it becomes pathological. For example, when smoking has percolated into a deeper level than a mere habit and the lack of a cigarette actually manifests itself as a headache or other such physical ailment.

Although yoga is often associated with the body, the purpose of yoga is more intrinsically related to the mind. Yoga is practiced to create peace of mind.</span><br/><br/><span>However, a state of calmness and peace is our natural state. Essentially, anything we do takes us out of our natural state of being. We are the masters of our mind and body, so there is no need to do anything in order to attain a state of peace, including the practice of yoga. So then why do we need to do all these practices to obtain our original state of peace?</span><br/><br/><span>Being is our natural state and doing is an unnatural state, like a dream. We have incorrectly identified ourselves with doing rather than being. With that being the case, how can ‘doing’ something now assist us in ‘being.’</span><br/><br/><span>To further understand how doing assists in being, let us explore the example of detergent. Detergent is used to take stains and dirt off of fabric. However, detergent itself is a type of dirt/stain.

Although yoga is often associated with the body, the purpose of yoga is more intrinsically related to the mind. Yoga is practiced to create peace of mind.</span><br/><br/><span>However, a state of calmness and peace is our natural state. Essentially, anything we do takes us out of our natural state of being. We are the masters of our mind and body, so there is no need to do anything in order to attain a state of peace, including the practice of yoga. So then why do we need to do all these practices to obtain our original state of peace?</span><br/><br/><span>Being is our natural state and doing is an unnatural state, like a dream. We have incorrectly identified ourselves with doing rather than being.

Detergent is used to take stains and dirt off of fabric. However, detergent itself is a type of dirt/stain.

Therefore others must ask another question, “How do we detach and practice slowness? How do we obtain a calm state of mind?” The great Arjuna belongs to this category. That is why he asks Krishna the question, “Krishna, you ask me to calm the mind, but it is so difficult. I can stop the vayu but to control the mind is very difficult.”</span><br/><span>We must face that it is difficult to calm the mind. For that purpose, we sit down peacefully, quietly wanting to control the mind. In two minutes, our legs start hurting. Now we need to change our position as we try to continue to calm our mind. But now the new posture begins causing pain. Your body does not cooperate with you. After you take care of all those things and so you sit down again to calm the mind and suddenly you feel hungry. You want a small cookie or something. But you just had a meal so how could you feel hungry? So you strongly tell yourself, “ I am not going to listen to my stomach. Let me calm my mind.” You want to be very serious about this, but the mind is very tricky. Once you decide that you do not want to think about the body, your body begins to create hurdles for you such as pain or an itch. The body is coming in the way of a peaceful mind. Hence, you need to do something to the body so that the body will help you calm down the mind, such as physical yoga techniques. In order to keep the mind calm, the body needs to relax. The physical level is not the only level at which we have disturbances within our personality. For example, we have disturbances in our prana which we will discuss at a later time.</span><br/><br/><span>All of these disturbances that are at every level of our personality begin to percolate deep within us and begin to effect our pathology and becomes the cause for sickness in us. When we remove these disturbances, we regain health. This is how we work in yoga therapy. In a future topic we will discuss sickness from the point of view of yoga and how yoga can help alleviate the sickness. </span><br/><br/><span>Another important aspect of these disturbances, which we today call stress, is how they develop from our mind. There are so many disturbances in the mind so if we need to find a solution for the stress, a technique to control the mind. The affects of this stress limits our potential. For example, when we are agitated, our memory is lessened and our creativity is diminished. In this sense, every walk of life needs peace of mind. Now the question is how do we apply that in our various personality levels? Because we are not only the body, but also the mind, we are often times identified with intellect and other times emotion. </span><br/><br/><span>So we come to the important questions of “what am I? Who am I? What is this thing “I”? This is a very important philosophical question. Our whole life passes without ever knowing what “I” is. We use the word “I” so frequently and so easily- “I am happy, I am sad, I am angry, I am depressed, I am old, I am young.” We use the word “I” so freely but do we know what this “I” is? Another fundamental question is what is the use of knowing what “I” is?</span><br/><br/><span>When we delve into the inquiry of “I” we begin to see a beautiful definition of yoga. In the next topic we will take up this question of “I”. This inquiry will help us within yoga. When we investigate “I” and find yoga, we will explore integral yoga. That is why this practice is called “integrated yoga practice,” and what we refer to as IAYT- Integrated Approach of Yoga Therapy.</span><br/><br/><span>Love, </span><br/><span>Raghuram.</span><br/><br/><span>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</span><br/><span>Sri Raghuramji is in Japan.

Basically it refers to our memories of the past. Past has already passed, but what remains from the past is our memory. When we review our memories we often have thoughts like, ‘this person is bad, this person cheated me, this person hurt me, etc’. This is all the content of our memory – full of violence, not peace. Hence we need to remove all such thoughts in order to consciously keep the memory good to promote peace. Let us forget those things that are bad and remember those that give us peace. </span><br/><br/><span>In this moment, let us do everything in peace. That is the second step.

When peace envelopes everything, it is the definition of Aum. </span><br/><br/><span>This is the full meaning of the mantra. We are not praying for anything or asking for any favors; it is simply a peace chant. In nature there is always peace, but as human beings we lose peace and destroy it. To preserve the peace of creation, man has immense responsibility. We have forgotten that responsibility. With this mantra we are trying to remember what we are doing and trying to achieve in yoga. We are on a journey where knowledge is nourishment. Let us be conscious that whatever we learn should become energy that we pass on to others without any ego. It is a reminder for us, our duty, and our mission. We are not praying for anything so it is not directed at any particular God.

This is to indicate that the mantra is chanted between student and teacher and the relationship between student and the teacher is very intimate and one to one. It is always that way tat the student has a very sincere question and the teacher only addresses to student in total oneness in communication. It also does not mean that there were not many students with each teacher. Though there were many students the relationship between student and the teacher is always one to one. This is indicated in Upanishad that it is like a conduit where one end is the student and other end is the teacher. The flow between them is the knowledge and it is flowing from teacher to the student like the perennial river, called Saraswati. It is the gradient which facilitates the flow and neither the teacher gives and nor the student takes. Humble approach of the student can only create such gradient and flow happens if the teacher thinks he is one, such a teacher will then cease to be a spiritual teacher.

If the sun is not radiating that energy, what is the use of the sun? The sun’s usefulness does not lie in having the energy, but in radiating the energy as to energize others. Similarly, my energy should be able to make others energetic. I should be able to help others, so my energy should manifest outside, and that manifestation is called radiation. </span><br/><br/><span>For example, suppose I have a lot of energy and I can run extremely fast. If I am walking down a quiet road and hear a girl helplessly cry because she is in trouble and run the other way with all of my energy. What is the use of this energy? I should go and help the girl. </span><br/><br/><span>True energy in our hands is that energy which does not harm others, which does not become our ego but helps others. That is the idea of radiation. In that way, let this knowledge become strength and let this strength come out to help others.</span><br/><br/><span>With this energy and kindness we bestow on others, we begin to obtain compliments from others. These compliments start becoming my ego. The moment that I become egoistic and arrogant, I begin to develop hatred. In fact, one of the root causes for hatred is ego of knowledge. As we get more and more of an ego, we begin wanting others to sub-serve us. When people do not do as expected of them, we begin to dislike them, either because their knowledge is different from ours or they possess more knowledge than us. </span><br/><br/><span>Hence, we cannot let our knowledge become ego. How can we say that any knowledge belongs to us? We are not the creators or the inventors of this knowledge. Knowledge is passed on and on; it does not belong to anyone. Someone has given us knowledge and we pass it on. Hence, we have no reason to become egoistic of the knowledge. It is similar to being a tea pot.

Within the various types of knowledge ego, the most difficult thing to come out is the ego of the knowledge of philosophy, yoga, and spirituality is the most difficult ego to come out of. Hence, we must be very careful with this type of ego.</span><br/><br/><span>We previously discussed the story of Drona replying to his son, Aswatthama, when the son asked Drona, ‘Why are you not teaching me the special knowledge which you are teaching Arjuna?’ Drona questions him, ‘Are you asking this question as my son or as my student?’ Aswatthama wonders, ‘What is the difference?’ Drona replies, ‘My dear child, it makes much difference. The conversation between a father and a son is very different from that of a student and teacher. Their relationships are completely different.’ Although Aswatthama realizes that, he still has his doubt and says, ‘I am both, your student and your son. I suppose I can ask in any way. Suppose I am asking as your son. As a son, I have the right to your possessions, correct? Don’t you think you should give me the knowledge before you give it to others? Do you not love me?’ Drona replies with tears in his eyes, ‘My dear child, I love you immensely, and there is nothing on this Earth that I am in love with as much as I love you. The moment I hear you are not there, my breath will come to a halt at once. But you should understand that you have the right to all my riches in this world except my knowledge. It is so, because this knowledge does not belong to me. On the other hand, I belong to the knowledge. Therefore, I cannot give this knowledge to anybody because of my relationship to them; I must give it to the deserving student.’ From this conversation, it is clear that we belong to the knowledge and knowledge does not belong to us. Hence, we must be humble to the knowledge.</span><br/><br/><span>There is a great teacher of philosophy in India who was a teacher of Vivekananda. His name is Ramakrishna. Each word he spoke was an extraordinary piece of wisdom. Every lecture he gave was compiled into a book called ‘Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna.’ Gospel means ‘god’s words spoken from direct experience.’ Each word in that Gospel is amazing knowledge. Even with all that knowledge, he is humble. He ends the book by saying ‘as long as I live, so long I learn.’ Meaning that even with all the knowledge he possesses, he still has much to learn. Hence, it is important to become yoga students without ego.

If the sun is not radiating that energy, what is the use of the sun? The sun’s usefulness does not lie in having the energy, but in radiating the energy as to energize others. Similarly, my energy should be able to make others energetic. I should be able to help others, so my energy should manifest outside, and that manifestation is called radiation. </span><br/><br/><span>For example, suppose I have a lot of energy and I can run extremely fast. If I am walking down a quiet road and hear a girl helplessly cry because she is in trouble and run the other way with all of my energy. What is the use of this energy? I should go and help the girl. </span><br/><br/><span>True energy in our hands is that energy which does not harm others, which does not become our ego but helps others. That is the idea of radiation. In that way, let this knowledge become strength and let this strength come out to help others.</span><br/><br/><span>With this energy and kindness we bestow on others, we begin to obtain compliments from others. These compliments start becoming my ego. The moment that I become egoistic and arrogant, I begin to develop hatred. In fact, one of the root causes for hatred is ego of knowledge. As we get more and more of an ego, we begin wanting others to sub-serve us. When people do not do as expected of them, we begin to dislike them, either because their knowledge is different from ours or they possess more knowledge than us. </span><br/><br/><span>Hence, we cannot let our knowledge become ego. How can we say that any knowledge belongs to us? We are not the creators or the inventors of this knowledge. Knowledge is passed on and on; it does not belong to anyone. Someone has given us knowledge and we pass it on. Hence, we have no reason to become egoistic of the knowledge. It is similar to being a tea pot.

We have to enable its survival by providing adequate manure, water, and sunlight, so that it will grow. Hence, the second step is ‘to nourish.’ Nourishment has to be fully understood in the context of the mantra. Often we associate nourishment with external objects, such as the printed label on boxed food which indicates the amount of nourishment each serving provides. But the nourishment does not depend on the food that you give and its contents. The food may actually be very nourishing, but if it is not properly digested by the consumer, it will fail in its attempt to nourish. A food which is not digested properly is nothing more than a poison. A small plant needs some water no doubt but if you flood the plant with too much water and manure, the plant will drown and die. Similarly, if a small child is given highly nutritious food that is indigestible, how will s/he benefit? We have to give the child food that s/he can digest. Similarly, on our yogic path, the knowledge may be abundant but how we absorb and digest this knowledge is what determines our spiritual growth. </span><br/><br/><span>I am reminded of such an example when I visited a dear friend in Los Angeles, CA.

Can you share some of the important aspects of the lecture, so that I, too, may learn?”</span><br/><br/><span>She replied, “The Upanishads are a very tough subject.

Once it is out of their sense perception, they may attach with that for a few moments but it vanishes like the writing on the water. You can experience this when you go to the temples in India, when you come out of temple with a fruit in your hand; monkey tries to follow you for the fruit. Once you notice that, then hide the fruit from the sight of monkey, after a couple of steps, monkey leaves you behind, wondering why am I following this person. Even the human being is also so much connected with and associates himself with what is existing and how long it is existing and where and when it is existing, etc. All this information is provided by our senses, because all this information is in the form of manifestation. This we call it as material. Therefore it is natural that our concern with what is existing is the material concern.</span><br/><span>The moment that what is existing goes away, we suffer the separation and we are in pain. We wish what we touched should not go from the view of our touch, what we see should not go away from our sight, what we interact should not go into non-existence. Even the very thought of it we suffer.</span><br/><span>I was working in a small job in Hyderabad, on the weekends I would go for 2 days to my aunt’s house in a colony and I would play with all the children there. These children including of course my aunt’s children would be waiting the whole week very eagerly and they are excited to see me coming. But simultaneously they also become aware that I would be going away after 2 days. Out of innocence they question, when I am going away as soon as I come. In the culture it is like this, when somebody comes, the first question should not be “when do you go” It is not decent. The mother would be whispering behind, that they should not question like that. But it is all the same for the children. They start worrying about the time I go away. It is all because what comes has to go away one day.</span><br/><span>Even as star light travels to you from distance of billions of light years, scientists say by the time you are actually seeing the star, it may not be there. It would have disintegrated and vanished.</span><br/><span>On the other hand look at the soap bubble, which exists for less than a few minutes, it has imperceptible thin wall, which is also totally transparent, inside and out it has the same air, and the bubble has very insignificant mass, not even has a single skeleton structure to support it. In spite of it, the soap bubble with that kind of a structure in that short time, freely sails on the wings of the wind in the free space not only reflecting but also refracting the beautiful sun rays with 7 colors dancing around in all liveliness, proudly showing it is extraordinary ability to do all that and not caring for whether anybody appreciates the bubble or not. A short life but a very lively way of living, you can see in that soap bubble. When we are associated with what is existing, then we realize what is there today is not going to be there tomorrow. Particularly, when we know that it is not going to be there tomorrow, we are more saddened and we are so much preoccupied about tomorrow that the sadness that it is not going to be there tomorrow will influence even today and we are spoiled. The object that is existing if we hold on to it, our hold is limited to one object only and we know that that object will not come back. However great the object may be, however precious the object may be or even if the object may be a great personality, anything for that matter will not come back in its original form.</span><br/><span>Like the world has been visited by many great persons like Buddha, Ram, Jesus or Vivekananda, on day or the other all of them had to go away sooner or later. And in that form that they were existing, they never come back. Even when people say about reincarnation, it is not the same person who comes back but it is a different person in a different form. And absolutely very unique.</span><br/><span>But then why do we say reincarnation? We can see the reincarnation is of the degree of compassion, the degree of knowledge and wisdom, or the degree of freedom and love for humanity. These are the things which reincarnate. And these are the qualities which remind about the person existing previously. So the reincarnation is possible, not for the person but for these qualities.</span><br/><span>What is existing today may not be existing tomorrow. If you are holding to an object from outside, you are bound to lose it one day or the other.</span><br/><span>The child is so lovely to look at. It is so enjoyable to see the innocence of the child. But the mother who is enjoying the innocence of the child and engrossed in it, so realizes that the child is growing and the innocence is going away. Mother already feels missing and losing the child. But that is the law of life.</span><br/><span>Don’t relate to what is existing – that is material. That is the materialistic way of being. In spite of relating to what is existing, if you connect to the existence it self, that is spiritual, that is divinity. You can find that existence everywhere, in ever so many forms. What is existing is limited, whereas what is the existence is unlimited. What is existing is finite and the existence behind is infinite. And it has to variety, never-ending. And the infinite is called as the Brahman. That is why the scriptures to say “Existence is God.” The existence you may call it as Ahuramasta or Allah or Brahman. It is all the same. Only if you can understand them and give them the meaning as infinite, and what is not existing but the existence itself, then there is no difference. This existence itself is called as “sat” in Sanskrit.</span><br/><span>The second aspect that wonders me, is when I look at a simple plant very insignificantly standing on the earth, having very nice beautiful delicate flowers, I wonder. After all that plant needs only a small of lump of clay, and a little water and sunshine and the air around. What are that extraordinary intelligence and the practical mechanism that exists in that tiny plant, that it can convert all that it receives from the lump of clay into a nice delicate lovely flower? Even the most genius of the human beings, when he is given a lump of clay, and with all his brilliance he cannot convert this clay into flower. There is such a great wisdom hidden inside the tiny plant.</span><br/><span>We always find the knowledge of something or the other. The knowledge of chemistry, the knowledge of physics, the knowledge of computer or the knowledge of marketing, this is all what we are aware of – these are the things that we are aware of. But this knowledge is something which is like the painting done on a canvas. It is already expressed, and this knowledge keeps continuously flowing, it keeps changing from time to time. The deeper and deeper, one goes to the knowledge, he realizes the narrower it becomes. Earlier people used to know about medicine, but when one started going deep, there are so many specializations developed. And going further deep, they have become super-specialized and now the knowledge belongs to a very narrow area. It is natural to become like that, because how much information, details you can handle? Like the way that how much information can be written on a canvas or on a blackboard, that is why we see in this world, the more and more we expand our knowledge on one side, we are becoming narrowing and narrowing on the other side.</span><br/><span>I really do not know where we can have such simple knowledge the plant has, that we take the lump of soil and we convert it into a nice flower or a delicious fruit. We may not reach that stage. So we can see that with all this development of knowledge, the simple knowledge of the plant looks like unattainable. We feel depressed. All that what we need to do is to look at the knowledge substance on which this knowledge can be written.</span><br/><span>We think that knowledge can be especially privilege for human being. This is our arrogance. What humbles me is that a tiny plant has such intelligence to create a flower and that intelligence we can never reach.</span><br/><span>The plant also has that knowledge substance, on which the wisdom can be written about making a flower out of lump of clay, and the plant acts accordingly. I was watching an animal channel on TV, the little tortoises come out of their eggs and they rush towards the ocean on the full moon night. Hundreds of them running to the ocean give a spectacular view. Who taught them to go the ocean? They also have that knowledge substance on which this knowledge can be written that the baby tortoise goes to the water as soon as it comes out of the egg. This knowledge itself may be limiting, the tortoise knows only to go the water, the hunters put their nets near the ocean, and these innocent tortoise babies, are walking to these nets. The knowledge of this tortoise is limited. The knowledge of the plant is also limited. The plant can only produce that variety of color or flower. It cannot change. Similarly the knowledge of the human being is also very limited. You write the knowledge of engineering on the knowledge substance of a human being, then that person will only know about the engineering and not about any other subject. This is very limited.</span><br/><span>The knowledge may be limited but look at the knowledge of substance, it is unlimited. It is there in the whole creation, right from a plant, to the animal and to the human being. The knowledge substance is there. And this knowledge substance is eternal. This knowledge is fresh for a caveman, and the knowledge substance is fresh and is present a high-tech man. And the knowledge substance is fresh in case of a grass-plant to a huge banyan tree, it is present everywhere. This knowledge substance is infinite and eternal*.</span><br/><span>Even a mosquito can be so intelligent. It can sit on your body to have his feast. At such locations that you cannot reach it. And they feast on you.</span><br/><span>The knowledge substance is called “chit” in Vedanta. So Brahman or the God is the Chit. This Chit is eternal and infinite. It is the substratum of all the knowledge – past, present and future. Any kind of knowledge belongs to Chit. There are no limitations of this knowledge that Chit can have it. That is why chit is infinite.</span><br/><span>Let us come to the third aspect; we are here which the existence aspect – sat aspect is and that we know we are here which is the knowledge aspect or chit aspect. But along with these 2, we have the 3rd aspect, which is the experience. The experience of the joy is the basic pursuit of life. The both sat and Chit pursues the experience of joy as the pursuit of life. Even the plants try to be happy, animals certainly do as human beings we do things because the things give us happiness, we do not do things because they don’t give us happiness. This experience need to be also understood from very deeper perspective. What is apparent outside is that the object or the situations give us happiness. Holding on to that truth at that level is very superficial. It does not have the quality of eternity and infinity. An object which gives one happiness may not give happiness to the other. One may wonder how come that object gives other person happiness, and the same way the 2nd person wonders how that object cannot give happiness to the 1st. Because hastily we come to a general conclusion that what gives me happiness should give happiness to the others too. But the truth is not in that way. The music that I love my own wife and son may wonder how that can give me happiness. But at the same time the music my son listens wonder how come that gives him happiness. The food that I put it in my tongue, gives me the experience of immeasurable joy, whereas the same food my wife has to struggle to take it.</span><br/><span>A small little girl invited me to her house when I was in Delhi for some official work. In the evening when I went she wanted my help in preparing the greeting card to present to her teacher. I have some talents of an artist, when she made the card with my help; it came out very artistic and very attractive. That very y moment she felt excited out of bounds of joy, but the next moment she ran to the kitchen to mom crying. I could not understand why she suddenly upset. This time her mother came with her to me saying “Raghuramji the card came out so nice that she liked it very much, but at the same time she is upset because she has to give it away to her teacher. Then to remove her sadness, I agreed to make another card. Making sure that it will not be that nice. So by making the card, she found that I was carrying a book with me. And then she asked me “uncle what is the book that you are reading?” I replied, “It is a book of Vedanta. Philosophy.” “What do you mean by Vedanta?” she asked me. I said, “don’t worry, it is all philosophy and boring for you.” Then she questioned me, “uncle you are so nice, you tell nice stories, and you do great artwork, but why do you have to read such boring books?” I can’t solve her, “look dear, I not only meet children like you, but I also spend some time with elders like your dad. They won’t like me doing artwork. They like me talking about Vedanta.” As if she understood the point, she said, “Yes I can understand my dad, that he likes things boring.”</span><br/><span>What is happiness for adults or for elders is boring for children. What you would enjoy as a child, you would not enjoy as an adult.</span><br/><span>The object of happiness can vary from person to person and from time to time. They are not consistent, they keep changing and the degree of happiness also varies from time to time. And from situation to situation. When somebody says I was absolutely happy, listening to that music, I wonder how he can enjoy that music. But at the same time, I can agree and understand the fact that he is extremely happy.</span><br/><span>So instead of going to what gives us happiness, if we hold on to the happiness itself, that is divine. Holding on to the object of happiness is worldly, non-eternal and non-infinite. Another important aspect of that, which is holding on to that object of happiness, is that these objects of happiness may get outdated and newer and newer objects may be coming up with the advance of the technology. The objects get outdated insipid and stupid. But man will be having the experience of happiness all the time. Cave man was also happy around his times, and today’s man of technology is also happy and we really do not know, where the future takes man to. But certainly he is going to be happy. It is wrong to think man is only happy with this technology and without this, he was unhappy.</span><br/><span>An American business president went to Bahamas Island for a week long vacation. While lying on the beach, for sun tan, a boy came to him to sell tender coconuts. The man asked for one, and while the boy was breaking the coconut, the man looked at him and said, “Hi, I think I have seen you somewhere?” the boy replied “where else, it must be here only. Because I am here only since the time I was born.” “Yes it must be true” the man recollected, “last year when I came for vacation, you gave me coconut water, I remember.” “I don’t remember” careless answer, “you are one of the million that visits here” “that is true, would you like to come with me to America?” the man asked. “For what?” “I can fix you in my company” the proud answer. “Why?” the boy asks. “How much do you earn per day here? About ten dollars?” than man added, “I can pay you 50 dollars a day, which is 5 times more.” “What do I do with that?” the innocent boy “so that you can save money and go to school” the quick response from man. “And then what?” the boy wants more details “and then you can be a graduate, and I can give you a big job.” “And then?” “And then you can also start a company like me, and have several people working for you” the confident man replied. “And then?” the boy looks with a question mark. “And then they will look after the company, and you can go on vacation, I suppose to this island and spend a week here like me.” He speaks from wisdom. “But that is what I am doing already and all times, staying in this island.” The boy’s final position.</span><br/><span>That is what we think. That without all this technology, we think man is unhappy and once the technology is there man can be happy. Man always has been in all circumstances having happiness, whether the technology is there or not, rich or poor, ignorant or knowledgeable, etc. So the happiness appears now to be given by the object outside, but closely observing it is not true. It is our inner nature. Object only helps us to touch our inner nature which is called “Ananda” or bliss. If the object does not help us to touch to our inner nature, then we come to the conclusion that object does not give us happiness. When an object does not help us to touch our inner nature happiness, we think the object does not contain happiness, and therefore it can also not give happiness to the others. This is a hasty conclusion. If only you can hold on to your nature happiness, the object is given to you or not, you can continue to be happy. Holding on to the object outside is short-lived, limited. Holding on to the happiness itself is eternal and infinite. Because the happiness itself is eternal, infinite and Brahman. That is why; Brahman is also “ananda”. So what we call it as God, what we call it as the divinity, is not some individual sitting up in the sky, but is this existence “Sat”, knowledge-based “chit”, and happiness “ananda. It is our fondness for our race that we picturize god to be having a form, precisely a human form with the hands and legs, sensory organs that we have. In some cases, they are so attached not only to their own race but to their gender. They say “God can only be He.” And not even she.</span><br/><span>Dharma is that which gives us the ability to reach “satchitananda”; existence, knowledge-based and bliss. Let us not mystify it, let us understand dharma is that which takes us away from our attachment to what exists and takes us towards what is existence. Similarly, takes us away from what knowledge to what is knowledge based. And thirdly Dharma takes us away from the notion that the object gives us happiness, to what happiness itself is, namely “ananda”.</span><br/><span>This existence, knowledge-based happiness is our own very nature and divinity hidden deep within.</span><br/><span>It is something which will give the useful turn in the direction of pursuit from outside to inside. An outside also should be made use of in such a way that it can takes us inwards. As long as the journey inwards has not started, you are still worldly. However greater a religious man may be, or however greater the philanthropist may be, or however extraordinary truths he may be sharing with his thoughts, however deep rituals he may be practicing, and whatsoever pilgrim centers he may be visiting, it is all worldly, and not spiritual, as long as they did not help that person to turn inwards.</span><br/><span>How can dharma help us in the pursuit to take us inwards, we will see in future discussions.</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span><br/><br/><span>*) The difference of infinite and eternal can be explained with the following example in three steps: the flowering is infinite and eternal, while the flowering is a process that will never end (which is the property of eternity) and also with endless possibilities (attribute of infinite). Rose flowering is finite but eternal, while the rose flowering will also be existent in the creation all the time, but it is limited to flowering “rose” only and not anything else (attribute of finite). The rose flower itself is finite and non-eternal, while it is spoiled in a few days and the manifestation of the flower is limited as rose only.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Animals are connected with what is there existing in front of their senses. Once it is out of their sense perception, they may attach with that for a few moments but it vanishes like the writing on the water. You can experience this when you go to the temples in India, when you come out of temple with a fruit in your hand; monkey tries to follow you for the fruit. Once you notice that, then hide the fruit from the sight of monkey, after a couple of steps, monkey leaves you behind, wondering why am I following this person. Even the human being is also so much connected with and associates himself with what is existing and how long it is existing and where and when it is existing, etc. All this information is provided by our senses, because all this information is in the form of manifestation. This we call it as material. Therefore it is natural that our concern with what is existing is the material concern.</span><br/><span>The moment that what is existing goes away, we suffer the separation and we are in pain. We wish what we touched should not go from the view of our touch, what we see should not go away from our sight, what we interact should not go into non-existence. Even the very thought of it we suffer.</span><br/><span>I was working in a small job in Hyderabad, on the weekends I would go for 2 days to my aunt’s house in a colony and I would play with all the children there. These children including of course my aunt’s children would be waiting the whole week very eagerly and they are excited to see me coming. But simultaneously they also become aware that I would be going away after 2 days. Out of innocence they question, when I am going away as soon as I come. In the culture it is like this, when somebody comes, the first question should not be “when do you go” It is not decent. The mother would be whispering behind, that they should not question like that. But it is all the same for the children. They start worrying about the time I go away. It is all because what comes has to go away one day.</span><br/><span>Even as star light travels to you from distance of billions of light years, scientists say by the time you are actually seeing the star, it may not be there. It would have disintegrated and vanished.</span><br/><span>On the other hand look at the soap bubble, which exists for less than a few minutes, it has imperceptible thin wall, which is also totally transparent, inside and out it has the same air, and the bubble has very insignificant mass, not even has a single skeleton structure to support it. In spite of it, the soap bubble with that kind of a structure in that short time, freely sails on the wings of the wind in the free space not only reflecting but also refracting the beautiful sun rays with 7 colors dancing around in all liveliness, proudly showing it is extraordinary ability to do all that and not caring for whether anybody appreciates the bubble or not. A short life but a very lively way of living, you can see in that soap bubble. When we are associated with what is existing, then we realize what is there today is not going to be there tomorrow. Particularly, when we know that it is not going to be there tomorrow, we are more saddened and we are so much preoccupied about tomorrow that the sadness that it is not going to be there tomorrow will influence even today and we are spoiled. The object that is existing if we hold on to it, our hold is limited to one object only and we know that that object will not come back. However great the object may be, however precious the object may be or even if the object may be a great personality, anything for that matter will not come back in its original form.</span><br/><span>Like the world has been visited by many great persons like Buddha, Ram, Jesus or Vivekananda, on day or the other all of them had to go away sooner or later. And in that form that they were existing, they never come back. Even when people say about reincarnation, it is not the same person who comes back but it is a different person in a different form. And absolutely very unique.</span><br/><span>But then why do we say reincarnation? We can see the reincarnation is of the degree of compassion, the degree of knowledge and wisdom, or the degree of freedom and love for humanity. These are the things which reincarnate. And these are the qualities which remind about the person existing previously. So the reincarnation is possible, not for the person but for these qualities.</span><br/><span>What is existing today may not be existing tomorrow. If you are holding to an object from outside, you are bound to lose it one day or the other.</span><br/><span>The child is so lovely to look at. It is so enjoyable to see the innocence of the child. But the mother who is enjoying the innocence of the child and engrossed in it, so realizes that the child is growing and the innocence is going away. Mother already feels missing and losing the child. But that is the law of life.</span><br/><span>Don’t relate to what is existing – that is material. That is the materialistic way of being. In spite of relating to what is existing, if you connect to the existence it self, that is spiritual, that is divinity. You can find that existence everywhere, in ever so many forms. What is existing is limited, whereas what is the existence is unlimited. What is existing is finite and the existence behind is infinite. And it has to variety, never-ending. And the infinite is called as the Brahman. That is why the scriptures to say “Existence is God.” The existence you may call it as Ahuramasta or Allah or Brahman. It is all the same. Only if you can understand them and give them the meaning as infinite, and what is not existing but the existence itself, then there is no difference. This existence itself is called as “sat” in Sanskrit.</span><br/><span>The second aspect that wonders me, is when I look at a simple plant very insignificantly standing on the earth, having very nice beautiful delicate flowers, I wonder. After all that plant needs only a small of lump of clay, and a little water and sunshine and the air around. What are that extraordinary intelligence and the practical mechanism that exists in that tiny plant, that it can convert all that it receives from the lump of clay into a nice delicate lovely flower? Even the most genius of the human beings, when he is given a lump of clay, and with all his brilliance he cannot convert this clay into flower. There is such a great wisdom hidden inside the tiny plant.</span><br/><span>We always find the knowledge of something or the other. The knowledge of chemistry, the knowledge of physics, the knowledge of computer or the knowledge of marketing, this is all what we are aware of – these are the things that we are aware of. But this knowledge is something which is like the painting done on a canvas. It is already expressed, and this knowledge keeps continuously flowing, it keeps changing from time to time. The deeper and deeper, one goes to the knowledge, he realizes the narrower it becomes. Earlier people used to know about medicine, but when one started going deep, there are so many specializations developed. And going further deep, they have become super-specialized and now the knowledge belongs to a very narrow area.

It is the substratum of all the knowledge – past, present and future. Any kind of knowledge belongs to Chit. There are no limitations of this knowledge that Chit can have it. That is why chit is infinite.</span><br/><span>Let us come to the third aspect; we are here which the existence aspect – sat aspect is and that we know we are here which is the knowledge aspect or chit aspect. But along with these 2, we have the 3rd aspect, which is the experience. The experience of the joy is the basic pursuit of life.

Because I notice that we are now going through some kind of yoga-mania, and everyone has to say something about yoga. But I’ve noticed that yoga is most positioned like something, like an escape from this chaotic and exhausting world, people leave this world and they go and sit for meditation, this is the image.</span><br/><span>On the other hand, yoga’s also like a medicine to be much more successful human doing, like you say in your talks.</span><br/><span>How do you look, feel about all this?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong><br/><span>That’s a very beautiful way you presented the question. Yes, yoga has taken multi-forms, expressions. People are doing anything in the name of yoga. That’s the reason why there is one good thing and one bad thing.</span><br/><span>The good thing about this is- at least people started recognizing and learning about yoga. If not today, another two years, three years. They would like to inquire into what are the texts which talk about yoga, where the ideas of yoga come from. So you start investigating into it, and the moment you start investigating into it, you will come to the right understanding about yoga. A little bit of inquiry tells us what is right, what is wrong. So I have no doubt- let the whole world take yoga and everybody start looking at what exactly is the idea of yoga, where is it coming from, and they will come to the right understanding.</span><br/><span>The bad thing about this is that we who have taken to yoga, let us investigate into it and see that logically the texts which give us yoga, the concepts that talk about yoga, you can easily get the right information, what exactly yoga is all about. So that way, people are running away from the work. People are trying to become meditative and this and that, they would like to run away from the work, people have a fear that people takes me away from the work. Yoga does not take you away from your useful work. Yoga brings about an awareness- one of the most important contributions of yoga is to bring about awareness, and the moment you develop awareness you start inquiring into whether what you are doing is useful or not. See.</span><br/><span>Like a simple thing is gossip- like two four? Persons are gossiping. They get annoyed by how the time flies. Why? Because you don’t have the awareness. But the moment you become aware then you start thinking ‘hey, I can do much better work than spending time in gossip’. The awareness brings about the correctness. So this is how basically, people who are spending their time otherwise in the not useful means, the moment that they do yoga, their awareness brings them back into rightness. In fact it is said- if you are telling a lie, if you are aware, you cannot tell a lie. If you are doing harm, if you are hurting somebody, if you just become aware you cannot hurt somebody, once you become conscious of it. So this awareness will put you in the right path. So the people who are otherwise spending their time in wasteful ways, they start saying that why this man, this woman, is withdrawing from the group? Yes, it’s important that we need to withdraw from the group, because we should show that this is something much better than all of the things that we are doing. You know, how much time, money, things like that, we are wasting?</span><br/><span>Once I happened to go to Las Vegas. And it is a place where I had a habit of getting up early morning at 4:30 – 5:00, and 5:00 Las Vegas goes to sleep. Whereas I got up and came outside, I was going for long walks, it is a beautiful city. And after long walk I come back around 8:00 I found that in one of those casinos there were coin machines, and there were two elderly women sitting there and putting the coins and pulling the lever. I was so surprised- they were 80 years and sitting there and putting the coins. So I said let me develop an interesting conversation with them. I went to those ladies and said ‘good morning’.</span><br/><span>They said ‘yes good morning, how are you doing?’</span><br/><span>and I said ‘you know, we have a saying in India that ‘early morning luck is very good luck. So it seems that you are trying your early morning luck’.</span><br/><span>Then she said, ‘ah well, no luck, no nothing. We were not getting sleep, that’s why we came out. And you ask us making money? No, nothing. We are killing time’.</span><br/><span>I said ‘you know, they give you this time, the medical community is doing so much research, spending millions of dollars, so much research to see that your age is extended by ½ hour, half a month, half a year. They are very happy, proud of it, you know? And that research, spent money, and all the research that has given you that time, and you are killing that time? What is the use of doing all that research?’</span><br/><span>This is what happens. We are unnecessarily killing our time in so many other things whereas the moment you start doing yoga, I’m sure that your time will be usefully spent. But once again, when the time is usefully spent does not mean that you have to increase your productivity. You know that productivity, material progress, has an inherent defect in it. The inherent defect is- we think that the happiness is there in the object outside. The object gives me happiness, more money gives me happiness, better production gives me happiness, my profits which touch millions of dollars give me happiness. Closely watch, is it really giving you happiness. No. We are completely hypnotized into that idea. Whereas, happiness is our nature. I don’t say that you do not produce, you produce wonderful. But produce so that more and more people will be happy, not because that your happiness will increase. So basically, we should never get into the paradigm that the objects give me happiness. If that is going to give me happiness- look at what happened to your grandfathers&hellip; Were they not happy? They did not have all these things. They never knew computers. They were so very happy because neither computers were there, nor computer viruses!</span><br/><span>When we did not have all these riches, we were happy. Objects are not contributing to our happiness, but objects are giving us some conveniences. Just making life a little more easier. When we used to use a lamp, now we just switch a light on, that’s all. It’s a little bit more convenient but not an addition to happiness.

The flower creates itself out of the elements like earth sun etc. And you say that there is a knowledge doing this. But it may be also said that the flower (and everything else)exists just because of the properties of matter. As soon we take away the matter there is no flower and knowledge is also not there. The knowledge which creates the flower only exists in connection with matter. If matter is not there knowledge can also not be there.</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong><span> Creation essentially has two aspects or substances. one is the material cause and the other is the intelligence cause. the latter I called as knowledge substance which is normally referred to as property of the material or element. In this regard there is a slight difference in thinking which is material is the property of the knowledge or intelligence and not the other way round. At element level there is intelligence which begets the material like the wetting intelligence be gets water burning intelligence begets fire etc. And again the flower intelligence with the help of such elements or the intelligences and with their rightful combination will bring out flower. Same way in a human being it is the intelligence body which is subtle begets the physical body which is the gross.</span><br/><br/><strong>question: </strong><span>Even if there is just a slight change in the properties of matter the flower will not come. For instance if you heat the seeds above a certain temperature the seeds cannot create a plant anymore. There is no knowledge which can even overcome the smallest changes in matter. So where is the knowledge independent from matter?</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer: </strong><span>at the seed level the intelligence is limited only to the degree that if the conditions are suitable within that range they will be able to give manifestation to their intelligence and flower flowers. but the moment you alter the conditions beyond certain limits then they fail. their intelligence is in one sense extraordinary as to look at a the intelligence present in the seed within given a lump of clay moisture and such conditions it can bring out a plant and nice flowers which we can not do in a laboratory. But suddenly if he conditions change they can not have the freedom like if it snows they can not move into safer place! This is their limitations. their knowledge is fixed having lesser degree of freedom. where as at human level there is so much freedom.</span><br/><br/><strong>question: </strong><span>Even when one says it is not expressed but it is there. How can we say that it is there when we don´t perceive it apart from matter? When it is perceivable only in matter it is matter itself.</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer</strong><span>: This is the argument of materialists or existentialists say that there is nothing like intelligence. even if it is there it is nothing but the aspect of the matter. This argument extended further like the way intelligence is part of the matter even the intention and intuition also do not exist. or even if they exist they exist as part of the matter and not independent. And finally the soul also does not exist. With that view two dangers are there. One is that when we are physically there we are there and there is nothing beyond. Then there is no place for charity, compassion etc as superior values If I have material advantage I do if not I don&rsquo;t. there is nothing like moral and immoral. Second thing is how do you explain the experiences of people who meditate and have outer body experiences and the experience of body apartness etc.</span><br/><br/><strong>Question: </strong><span>And when it is not percievable apart from matter it is not there at all.</span><br/><br/><strong>Answer</strong><span>: There are therefore two strong positions in the world One is matter based Universe and the other is the consciousness based universe.

The influence of South Asian culture has spread globally and one of the pioneers and fastest expanding trends in the world comes from the most ancient texts and practices in India: YOGA. As the highly respected guru, Smt Nischala Joy Devi observed, “Within the United States alone, there are about twenty million people practicing yoga.” And then corrected herself by adding, “or some form of yoga.” With the advent of yoga magazines, yoga bags/mats, yoga clothing, and yoga studios, yoga tools and yoga diets it seems the entire world is embracing yoga and its benefits. Unfortunately, in the rapid growth of this “trend” the true meaning of Yoga and its benefits are often overlooked and the purpose of its practice is frequently diminished into a superficial form of physical exercise performed to obtain the “yoga body.” Many do not take time to ask the question, “What is yoga?” When we dig deeper into the question, we naturally look at the definition of yoga, not as it is defined by modern society, but, rather, through the definitions found in earlier yoga texts.The first written account of the definition of yoga is found in the most ancient texts of Hinduism, known as the Vedas and Upanishads.“Tam Yogam iti manyante stiram indriya dharanam”Controlling all of the senses, including the steadying of the mind, is known as yoga.Another ancient text on the philosophy of yoga, known as Yoga Vasista, was given to Lord Rama by Sage Vasista. “Manah prasamano payah yogah”A technique to calm the mind is yoga.And later, Sage Patanjali, who has compiled the knowledge of yoga and has written its treatise, defines yoga again.“Yogah chitta vrutti nirodah”Yoga is to cleanse the mind of disturbances.Likewise, the definition of yoga can be found in various other ancient Indian texts. In none of these texts do we find any sentence defining yoga as a set of physical postures. Hence, we can, without a doubt, begin to understand that there is much more to yoga than the contortion of the body into strange acrobatic positions or a type of physical achievement.While I was giving a talk about the research and therapeutic work in the field of yoga in Bangalore, a gentleman from the audience stood up and asked, “I do sirshasana (the head stand pose) for one hour everyday, is that okay?”For a moment, I pondered my answer. How could I tell him that doing a headstand for one hour is not yoga? It might be one of the postures in yoga, but yoga has such a deeper meaning and philosophy. After all, at least he is practicing sirshasana and is interested in yoga, so how could I discourage him? Compounded with that question he asked me if it is okay. I thought, if it were okay, then why would God create us head up, feet down and then say, “My dear friend, I made the mistake of creating you head up, feet down. Please correct me!” So then I answered, “Yoga means peace of mind.” And then light heartedly continued, “Yes, continue to do an hour in the headstand pose, so long as while you are in the headstand, people at home will have peace of mind… Further, if the head is not useful for any purpose, let it carry the weight of the body for an hour; it is good!”But we see that yoga is beyond the hour of physical postures when, in the Bhagavad-Gita, Krishna takes the purpose and meaning of yoga to a higher dimension, giving it a deeper notion. He tells Arjuna “Yogasthah kuru karmaani,” which means do every activity while in the state of yoga. This further defines yoga, not as doing something external, but rather, as a state within us. It is not connected with doing; it is connected with being. Even doing asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), or kriyas (cleansing exercises) are all external to us, but Krishna is not referring to these externalities; He is referring to the state of being. If we are so focused on what we are doing that we fail to internalize the practice, and then we are missing the purpose and idea of yoga. One may be a master of body contortions or become extremely non-violent to the point of not killing germs, but if his/her internal being has not transformed into peace, tranquility, and harmony, then s/he has missed the purpose of yoga. This takes us into the higher dimensions of understanding yoga which will be further detailed in upcoming articles.</span><br/><span>************************************************************************</span><br/><span>Let us take a minute of silence and prayer for all of those who lost belongings, loved ones, and even their own lives, during the dreadful natural disaster which hit South Asia and neighboring countries over the holidays.

D. Anderson News Release 05/12/06</span><br/><span>Researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have received a $2.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effects of Tibetan yoga in women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.</span><br/><br/><span>News Release - 06/04/06</span><br/><span>In an ongoing effort to scientifically validate the age-old belief that mind-body interventions have a beneficial impact on the health of cancer patients, researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have shown that breast cancer patients who participate in a yoga program during treatment have improved quality of life, compared to patients who do not.</span><br/><span>The study, presented today at the 42nd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology by Lorenzo Cohen, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Integrative Medicine Program at M. D. Anderson, is one of the first to incorporate yoga as part of a treatment plan for cancer patients. It&rsquo;s also the first collaborative research effort representing the partnership between M. D. Anderson and India&rsquo;s largest yoga research institution, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (research foundation) in Bangalore, India.</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;Cancer and its treatments are associated with considerable distress, impaired quality of life and reduced physical function. This is particularly true for women with breast cancer who receive multi-modality treatment over an extended period of time,&rdquo; Cohen says. &ldquo;With our studies, we think that we could help ameliorate the treatment-related side effects that accumulate in cancer patients over time.</span><br/><br/><span>&quot;The main objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating a daily yoga program into the treatment care plan for women with breast cancer undergoing radiation treatment, and determine if this is something the patients found useful and enjoyable, as well as assessing aspects of their quality of life,&rdquo; he continued.</span><br/><br/><span>Sixty-one women with breast cancer undergoing radiation were randomized to participate in the yoga classes twice weekly at, or around, the time of their radiation appointments, or, as the control group, to be offered yoga post-treatment. The patients ranged from Stage 0 to Stage 3 disease; 48 percent had undergone breast-conserving surgery, and 75 percent had received chemotherapy prior to radiation treatment. The yoga program was designed specifically for this patient population - emphasizing breathing and relaxation, and excluding some positions, for example, that would be difficult, given the patients&rsquo; possible weakened range of motion.</span><br/><br/><span>After just one week of yoga and radiation, the patients reported significantly increased physical function, as well as general health, compared to the control group. The study participants also reported marginally better social functioning, significantly lower levels of sleep-related daytime dysfunction, as well as marginally lower levels of fatigue overall. However, no differences in the level of depression or anxiety were found between the two groups.</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;It was gratifying to see that we could make a clinically significant difference in these quality of life of these women in such a brief program,&rdquo; says Kavita Chandwani, M.D., yoga instructor and co-investigator responsible for overseeing the trial. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s yoga or some other type of mind-body program, we believe this study shows how beneficial it is to participate throughout treatment to help with quality of life-based issues.&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><span>As a result of these positive findings, a follow-up study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, in breast cancer patients receiving radiation comparing yoga to stretching exercises and standard care is ongoing at M. D. Anderson. Also, from the ASCO highlighted study, Cohen and his team plan to analyze the cortisol levels, a stress hormone collected from saliva samples, and immune function measured from blood samples that were both collected as part of the study.</span><br/><span>M. D. Anderson recognizes the growing body of research indicating that relaxation-based interventions can contribute to the well-being of people with cancer. Through the Integrative Medicine Program, complementary therapies are offered through M. D. Anderson&rsquo;s freestanding facility, Place &hellip; of Wellness, and are used in concert with mainstream care to manage symptoms, relieve stress, and enhance quality of life for patients and their caregivers. M. D. Anderson&rsquo;s Integrative Medicine faculty also conduct research in the biological and behavioral effects of mind/body based interventions; the anti-cancer potential of natural compounds; and acupuncture to treat common cancer treatment-related side effects.</span><br/><span>Recently, Cohen and his team received a $2.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effects of Tibetan yoga in women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy; the grant is the largest ever to study Tibetan yoga in cancer patients.</span><br/><br/><span>©2006 The University of Texas M.

D. Anderson News Release 05/12/06</span><br/><span>Researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have received a $2.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effects of Tibetan yoga in women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.</span><br/><br/><span>News Release - 06/04/06</span><br/><span>In an ongoing effort to scientifically validate the age-old belief that mind-body interventions have a beneficial impact on the health of cancer patients, researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have shown that breast cancer patients who participate in a yoga program during treatment have improved quality of life, compared to patients who do not.</span><br/><span>The study, presented today at the 42nd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology by Lorenzo Cohen, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Integrative Medicine Program at M. D. Anderson, is one of the first to incorporate yoga as part of a treatment plan for cancer patients. It&rsquo;s also the first collaborative research effort representing the partnership between M. D. Anderson and India&rsquo;s largest yoga research institution, Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (research foundation) in Bangalore, India.</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;Cancer and its treatments are associated with considerable distress, impaired quality of life and reduced physical function. This is particularly true for women with breast cancer who receive multi-modality treatment over an extended period of time,&rdquo; Cohen says. &ldquo;With our studies, we think that we could help ameliorate the treatment-related side effects that accumulate in cancer patients over time.</span><br/><br/><span>&quot;The main objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating a daily yoga program into the treatment care plan for women with breast cancer undergoing radiation treatment, and determine if this is something the patients found useful and enjoyable, as well as assessing aspects of their quality of life,&rdquo; he continued.</span><br/><br/><span>Sixty-one women with breast cancer undergoing radiation were randomized to participate in the yoga classes twice weekly at, or around, the time of their radiation appointments, or, as the control group, to be offered yoga post-treatment. The patients ranged from Stage 0 to Stage 3 disease; 48 percent had undergone breast-conserving surgery, and 75 percent had received chemotherapy prior to radiation treatment. The yoga program was designed specifically for this patient population - emphasizing breathing and relaxation, and excluding some positions, for example, that would be difficult, given the patients&rsquo; possible weakened range of motion.</span><br/><br/><span>After just one week of yoga and radiation, the patients reported significantly increased physical function, as well as general health, compared to the control group. The study participants also reported marginally better social functioning, significantly lower levels of sleep-related daytime dysfunction, as well as marginally lower levels of fatigue overall. However, no differences in the level of depression or anxiety were found between the two groups.</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;It was gratifying to see that we could make a clinically significant difference in these quality of life of these women in such a brief program,&rdquo; says Kavita Chandwani, M.D., yoga instructor and co-investigator responsible for overseeing the trial. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s yoga or some other type of mind-body program, we believe this study shows how beneficial it is to participate throughout treatment to help with quality of life-based issues.&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><span>As a result of these positive findings, a follow-up study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, in breast cancer patients receiving radiation comparing yoga to stretching exercises and standard care is ongoing at M. D. Anderson. Also, from the ASCO highlighted study, Cohen and his team plan to analyze the cortisol levels, a stress hormone collected from saliva samples, and immune function measured from blood samples that were both collected as part of the study.</span><br/><span>M. D. Anderson recognizes the growing body of research indicating that relaxation-based interventions can contribute to the well-being of people with cancer. Through the Integrative Medicine Program, complementary therapies are offered through M. D. Anderson&rsquo;s freestanding facility, Place &hellip; of Wellness, and are used in concert with mainstream care to manage symptoms, relieve stress, and enhance quality of life for patients and their caregivers. M. D. Anderson&rsquo;s Integrative Medicine faculty also conduct research in the biological and behavioral effects of mind/body based interventions; the anti-cancer potential of natural compounds; and acupuncture to treat common cancer treatment-related side effects.</span><br/><span>Recently, Cohen and his team received a $2.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study the effects of Tibetan yoga in women with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy; the grant is the largest ever to study Tibetan yoga in cancer patients.</span><br/><br/><span>©2006 The University of Texas M.

There are TV shows such as ‘Fear Factor’ where they show live insects which the participants have to swallow or animal parts that are ground and eaten raw.

The plants do not have the freedom of locomotion, as do animals. Animals do not have the freedom of consciousness that humans have and are seen in organization. Animals, birds, and insects cannot organize. They may appear to be organizing a few things such as building a nest, etc, but their organization is based on instinct. This organization is programmed, not free.</span><br/><span>The highest degree of its manifestations is in the human race and least in matter. Even animals recognize consciousness, and humans not only recognize it but respect it and its manifestations. Because he respects the consciousness, his survival is the survival of the highest form of consciousness. He has to survive and for this he goes from the least manifestation of degree of consciousness which is in matter. Once this exhausts, he goes to the higher level which is plants. Going to plants and not going to the next level, animals, is his respect to the consciousness which is innately there in the human being. So vegetarianism essentially has the meaning of respect for the consciousness rather than the consideration of himsa or ahmisa, or killing or not killing, because if it is plants or animals, the need to kill is there. Only the case when man is in such a place where the plants are not available that he goes to eat meat.

People who are vegetarians, the cooking which is offered to God before they ate, the same way the meat is offered to God before consumption, it becomes sanctified.</span><br/><span>This has come up in the form of what is called “Animal Sacrifice” or “Bali.” Actually in the true sense, Bali is not just to kill animals in the name of offering so that the God is favorable to you, but it is the food that you are going to take for your hunger that you will offer to the God prior to consumption. What has to be offered to God should be the food that we eat. Unfortunately, the whole concept has been mistaken and human beings, who normally do not eat meat, are made to kill animals in the form of Bali so that the Gods will grant them special favors.</span><br/><span>And man will never eat another human because he is at the same level of consciousness.

Eating vegetarian food is considered highly spiritual not only in India, but in various cultures and religions throughout the world.</span><br/><span>For example, while I was in Romania, visiting a monastery, the nuns at the monastery offered my friend and myself food which contained meat. My friend explained to them that I do not eat mean. The nuns assumed that we may not know about Easter, so they explained that Easter had passed last week and so I was able to eat meat now. My friend further clarified to me that during Easter, Christians do not eat meat. My friend replied to the nun indicating that I am not eating meat because I am a vegetarian, not because of Easter. Immediately, the nun replied enthusiastically, “Then you must be really spiritual!” The other nun, with a frown, stated, “It is not that he is necessarily spiritual; it is just part of their culture.”</span><br/><span>One concept often overlooked or ignored, is that of energy. This is the one facet that can logically explain vegetarianism. We need food for the sake of energy and it is the only thing that can give us energy, for almost everyone.</span><br/><br/><strong>Energy Source:</strong><br/><span>Everyone has only one source of energy: the sun. We absorb the sun’s energy in various forms. Human beings absorb the sun energy in the form of pigmentation called melanin in the body. We cannot absorb and store the sun’s energy in any other form. Plants, on the other hand, absorb the sun’s energy in the process of photosynthesis. The plants are our next source of energy since they absorb the sun’s energy directly. Insects and animals consume these plants and process this energy and store it in their body. This is the food cycle said in the Bhagavad-Gita. The Gita says food can only be food for the food, i.e. the insects consume their food which is the plant and they themselves become food for other animals or birds and the bird’s die and their body will be consumed by other animals and when they die, they become soil which is the support of plants. This is how the food cycle is maintained. So if we want the most energy, we have to consume it from the closest level to direct absorption from the sun, which are plants.</span><br/><span>The source of energy is sun and if we cannot take energy from the source directly then the primary source is plants. It is easy to digest the simple cells of plants and release the energy from these cells. We do not have to wait for long for this energy to be released in our body. Animals and birds are the secondary and tertiary sources of energy. So, they have a complex cell structure in which they store this energy, so they need more time to release this energy. They sit in the stomach and our bodies need to work extremely hard to obtain the energy. This phenomenon can be observed in the amount of time it takes us to cook non-vegetarian food versus vegetarian food.</span><br/><span>Resource Requirements:</span><br/><span>In addition, statistics also show that when one is vegetarian, the resources needed for sustenance is minimal. The amount of land that is required to sow the seeds and grow the seeds and life can be managed is a well maintained 1 acre area! In this one acre one can produce all the varieties of food items when he is vegetarian. Whereas if somebody is non-vegetarian, then he will have the cattle (goat or cows or poultry) which will have to feed on the produce of this land and then process it. So such a person needs at least 15 acres of land first to feed the animals which in turn feed one in a day. So being a non-vegetarian, we use up the resources of the earth. In the Gita, Lord Krishna says it is the Lord who is dwelling in all living organisms and he is the one who is digesting the food through four ways: munching, licking, drinking, and sucking. When he describes these four methods, he is not only mentioning the ability of a human being but of all living beings. Plants make food from the soil, but it is the God in them. The plants are in turn eaten by animals or human beings. In other words, the life in animals and human beings is the divinity which is consumed by plants. When we or animals die, the bacteria will eat our physical beings. This cycle is the divinity in human beings. In this, ‘the life’s existence’ is the description in this divinity which is called ‘Sat.’ This cycle keeps going on at all times. Often some of the translators mention that God lives in he human being and the whole world is provided as food for the human being, so s/he is to eat whatever comes in his path to maintain her/his life. In this thought process the arrogance of man is hidden. Man feels that God has special care for man and he created the whole world for man to consume. But this is man’s imagination.</span><br/><span>Yet another interesting aspect of food and eating, we notice that the eating habits of humans and other animals are extremely different. In the case of all other beings, they are programmed as to what to eat and what not to eat. For example, the birds eat grains and insects. A cow eats grass and does not go to eat another animal unless he is forced to by humans. We have found that meat does not go well with the constitution of the animal. That is one of the reasons that cows developed “Mad Cow Disease” recently and later they found that the cows are fed with bone powder to ensure that their milk is rich with protein. Similarly, a tiger or a lion are programmed to hunt and eat meat. Just because there are no animals available or because there is a nice piece of fruit in front of them, they do not become vegetarian. In the case of Indian mythology, Lord Narasimha has the body of a human being but the head of a lion. He feeds on human flesh because though he is a Lord, he is in the form of half lion and thus kills Hiranyakashyap.</span><br/><span>Plants are programmed to eat the material from the earth. We cannot say my plant is very respectful and very sacred so let me feed this Tulsi (the sacred plant for all Indians within the country), some freshly cooked rice. However sacred the food or plant may be, the plant which does not get its necessary nutrients of the soil and earth, it will certainly die. The entire realm of creation is programmed to eat, except for the human being. Humans can eat plants, animals, fish, birds, eggs, and even another human. That is his freedom.</span><br/><span>Even then the law still holds well in creation, what Krishna stated in the Bhagavad-Gita that is food which sustains food. The food in all forms supports food.</span><br/><br/><span>-to be continued&hellip;</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><strong>Spirituality and Vegetarianism:</strong><br/><span>The next common discussion is the spirituality of vegetarianism.

We need food for the sake of energy and it is the only thing that can give us energy, for almost everyone.</span><br/><br/><strong>Energy Source:</strong><br/><span>Everyone has only one source of energy: the sun. We absorb the sun’s energy in various forms. Human beings absorb the sun energy in the form of pigmentation called melanin in the body. We cannot absorb and store the sun’s energy in any other form. Plants, on the other hand, absorb the sun’s energy in the process of photosynthesis. The plants are our next source of energy since they absorb the sun’s energy directly. Insects and animals consume these plants and process this energy and store it in their body. This is the food cycle said in the Bhagavad-Gita. The Gita says food can only be food for the food, i.e. the insects consume their food which is the plant and they themselves become food for other animals or birds and the bird’s die and their body will be consumed by other animals and when they die, they become soil which is the support of plants. This is how the food cycle is maintained. So if we want the most energy, we have to consume it from the closest level to direct absorption from the sun, which are plants.</span><br/><span>The source of energy is sun and if we cannot take energy from the source directly then the primary source is plants. It is easy to digest the simple cells of plants and release the energy from these cells. We do not have to wait for long for this energy to be released in our body. Animals and birds are the secondary and tertiary sources of energy. So, they have a complex cell structure in which they store this energy, so they need more time to release this energy. They sit in the stomach and our bodies need to work extremely hard to obtain the energy. This phenomenon can be observed in the amount of time it takes us to cook non-vegetarian food versus vegetarian food.</span><br/><span>Resource Requirements:</span><br/><span>In addition, statistics also show that when one is vegetarian, the resources needed for sustenance is minimal. The amount of land that is required to sow the seeds and grow the seeds and life can be managed is a well maintained 1 acre area! In this one acre one can produce all the varieties of food items when he is vegetarian. Whereas if somebody is non-vegetarian, then he will have the cattle (goat or cows or poultry) which will have to feed on the produce of this land and then process it. So such a person needs at least 15 acres of land first to feed the animals which in turn feed one in a day. So being a non-vegetarian, we use up the resources of the earth. In the Gita, Lord Krishna says it is the Lord who is dwelling in all living organisms and he is the one who is digesting the food through four ways: munching, licking, drinking, and sucking. When he describes these four methods, he is not only mentioning the ability of a human being but of all living beings. Plants make food from the soil, but it is the God in them. The plants are in turn eaten by animals or human beings. In other words, the life in animals and human beings is the divinity which is consumed by plants. When we or animals die, the bacteria will eat our physical beings. This cycle is the divinity in human beings. In this, ‘the life’s existence’ is the description in this divinity which is called ‘Sat.’ This cycle keeps going on at all times. Often some of the translators mention that God lives in he human being and the whole world is provided as food for the human being, so s/he is to eat whatever comes in his path to maintain her/his life. In this thought process the arrogance of man is hidden. Man feels that God has special care for man and he created the whole world for man to consume. But this is man’s imagination.</span><br/><span>Yet another interesting aspect of food and eating, we notice that the eating habits of humans and other animals are extremely different. In the case of all other beings, they are programmed as to what to eat and what not to eat. For example, the birds eat grains and insects. A cow eats grass and does not go to eat another animal unless he is forced to by humans. We have found that meat does not go well with the constitution of the animal. That is one of the reasons that cows developed “Mad Cow Disease” recently and later they found that the cows are fed with bone powder to ensure that their milk is rich with protein. Similarly, a tiger or a lion are programmed to hunt and eat meat. Just because there are no animals available or because there is a nice piece of fruit in front of them, they do not become vegetarian. In the case of Indian mythology, Lord Narasimha has the body of a human being but the head of a lion. He feeds on human flesh because though he is a Lord, he is in the form of half lion and thus kills Hiranyakashyap.</span><br/><span>Plants are programmed to eat the material from the earth. We cannot say my plant is very respectful and very sacred so let me feed this Tulsi (the sacred plant for all Indians within the country), some freshly cooked rice. However sacred the food or plant may be, the plant which does not get its necessary nutrients of the soil and earth, it will certainly die. The entire realm of creation is programmed to eat, except for the human being. Humans can eat plants, animals, fish, birds, eggs, and even another human. That is his freedom.</span><br/><span>Even then the law still holds well in creation, what Krishna stated in the Bhagavad-Gita that is food which sustains food. The food in all forms supports food.</span><br/><br/><span>-to be continued&hellip;</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"VEGETARIANISM -2- Aspects of Spirituality and Energy Source","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2006-06-07T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2006-06-07T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-06-07T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":166,"uuid":"78a3ab36-5fd3-4255-ad7e-e621b187378c","title":"VEGETARIANISM -1- Foreword","slug":"vegetarianism-1-foreword","markdown":"<p><span>Written on : Thursday, October 06, 2005</span><br/><br/><span>Vegetarianism: this one word has led to many lively debates and multiple questions.

But many non-vegetarian Hindus, only exclude the consumption of cows. This has led many to ask the question, “What is the reason that Hindus do not eat cows for meat?” To explain the value of cows, many Hindus explain that in the old days and in some rural areas today, cows were considered to be wealth. So naturally, with the respect of wealth, comes the respect of cows. Having a cow was like having a bank account, so it wasn’t eaten, much like how people don’t eat currency now. This answer may convince some, but others will be confused and question this reasoning. “Aren’t other animals considered wealth? Why can we eat the other animals and not the cows?” In addition, there are places in India where cows are considered wealth, but in such places, people specifically eat cows on important auspicious days, so how is that justified? Even further, some people attack vegetarianism by stating that even in the Vedas, there are references that they ate meat, particularly cow meat. So it becomes extremely difficult to justify not eating meat, especially cow meat for reasons of religion.</span><br/><span>So why are people vegetarian? Why do we think that being vegetarian is natural? The jaws of human beings are similar to herbivorous animals, even though we are omnivores.

But, this has to be scientifically proven before suggesting it to others. But many who are turning to Indian philosophy and yoga are becoming vegetarian for the simple purpose of health. In response to this claim, proponents of a non-vegetarian diet argue that there are many health disadvantages to being vegetarian. For example, vegetarians lack protein in their diets so one may not receive enough nourishment, unless they eat eggs. Recently my friend is diagnosed to have calcium deficiency and people started putting blame on her vegetarian diet. Further, it is a general opinion that eating meat makes you strong, athletic, and powerful, whereas, vegetarians are not as physically strong. This point is not completely refutable because there are some chemicals within the meat which make people more competitive and aggressive, but overall, there is not much evidence of overall contribution to the development of an individual and there are many contradictory opinions in this regard.</span><br/><span>Many other considerations have been made in regards to the type of people who are vegetarian and those who are not. Some say that with vegetarianism comes intelligence, compassion, etc. But, none of these thoughts have a logical reasoning behind them.

Only when we practice Yoga we can accurately be called as human beings.</span><br/><br/><span>Why do we come out of our nature? Why did God provided us this way of coming out, what is the use of it? Why did he not create us without being able to come out of our nature?</span><br/><br/><span>There is some usefulness in coming out of our nature. It is actually a life saving facility at the time of crisis, let us look at the classical example, explained in a modern way.</span><br/><br/><span>You are walking in a dark place, down a hazy path, where you cannot see anything except the ground that is directly ahead of you. Suddenly, you come cross a snake lying down right under your next step. You are shocked! The body becomes tense, the heart palpitates more quickly, and the mind is agitated. You are ready to jump! All of these changes are necessary for life saving decisions, but you cannot go forward or backward, you are arrested. Fortunately, the snake is sleeping, but you don’t want to disturb him.</span><br/><span>In the mean time, somebody walks behind you, nonchalantly putting his flash light on the path. Oh! You no longer see a snake, it is a rope. You breathe a sigh of relief. The fellow coming from behind doesn’t even notice you, you are sure now that it is not any more a snake. But it is only a rope. Even then, you cannot cross. You want to double check before you cross. You allow him to walk first, and then slowly and carefully you walk. May be the snake wakes up. And after crossing you look back. Making sure it is still only a rope and not a snake. Even then, for the next few hours, your body is still tensed. The prana is heightened. Your mind is agitated. Your blood pressure is up only for the next few hours. All these things take a long time to come back to its normal level!</span><br/><br/><span>The changes occur momentarily. But it takes long time to come back to the original state. The blood pressure goes up instantaneously at the moment of fear. But it takes long time to come down. This we can observe when we suddenly hear a big or unexpected sound. If there were a long pause between one incident and the other, then there is sufficient time gap for the blood pressure to come down and the body to relax. Earlier it was like that, but in today’s life style, before the body comes back to its original state, another incident occurs and then a third incident and it continues. The body continues to be tensed; the prana continues to be fast. The blood pressure, which has gone up, wants to comedown but before it comes down, you push it again and again. So the blood pressure stays up. It becomes a habit.</span><br/><br/><span>Thus the episodes of tension, speed etc., having repeatedly occurred become a habit. So all these altered changes are our habits, and the habit can be reversed by consciously working with a counter habit. If the tension has been our habit formed unconsciously driven by circumstances, yoga is the counter habit consciously practiced. Relaxation in doing asanas should be a conscious reversal. Similarly at the prana level, pranayama is the conscious reversal of speed into slowness. Meditation is a conscious process to calming down the mind.</span><br/><br/><span>If we don’t correct at the habit level, it percolates deep into us forming “vasanas”. Vasanas are hardened habits. Habits are superficial and they have not yet interfered with the pathology, but the vasanas are percolated into pathology. At the habit level, it is simple restlessness. Given an avenue, the habit would like to take over, but it does not disturb the physiology. But when the habit becomes a vasana, it interferes with our physiological function. It becomes pathological</span><br/><br/><span>People have the habit of drinking tea or coffee. It is habit acquired from outside. It has not come from birth, it is acquired from the world outside. When the tea drinking is at the habit level, if we don’t get tea, you feel little restless and uneasy. When it becomes vasana, it becomes pathological. It stars interfering with the natural body function. When the habit of drinking tea or coffee reaches the level of vasana, then without that one starts getting headache or one might not have his normal body functions in the morning. It means our body becomes a slave to the vasanas.</span><br/><br/><span>Our name, our religious faiths etc., they all percolate at the vasana level, which is definitely deeper than the conscious level, immediate unconscious level, like sleep. That’s why when a group of persons are sleeping along with you, and if your name is called out you will respond because only you hear and others may not respond for your name. That shows your name has gone into ‘sleep conscious level’. The same way in the dream state your religion does not change, a Hindu is still a Hindu, a Muslim is a Muslim; a politician is still a politician.</span><br/><br/><span>When not corrected at the vasana level, the same habits percolate deep in our body, affecting even the genetic level, which is called samskaras.</span><br/><br/><span>At the samskara level, they are at much deeper subconscious levels, and they percolate life after life. Anger, hatred, fear etc., all can percolate in us from life after life.</span><br/><br/><span>When I first joined in my job, I was still in my probation; I had a super boss, a superintending engineer, deeply wanting to become chief engineer. Just to illustrate how passionately he was nurturing the desire to become chief engineer, every morning when he came to the office, the first thing he said is that he had a dream last night where he became a chief engineer. Any temple he comes across, he goes to pray to god to make him chief engineer. The moment he sees any person with an ochre robe or otherwise religious looking, he falls at his feet and begs them to please bless him to become chief engineer.</span><br/><br/><span>One day I came to the office late, rushed into the elevator, and found ,this super boss in the elevator. Smilingly I said good morning. The elevator closed with only two of us in and started moving to the fifth floor. Like lightening, I found in a moment, this man touching my feet and saying “Raghuram, bless me; I have become chief engineer”. I said, “Sir, what is this I am so junior and you are senior, how I can bless you”. He replied “I heard people talking that you also do meditation, maybe you have powers so please bless me”. I blushed and said, “Sir, what if people see us. He replied “that’s’ why I am at your feet in the lift”.</span><br/><br/><span>And the lift stopped at the fifth floor and we both came out. At once he stated in strong tone, “Raghuram, why are you late?” I was surprised! Moments back he was at my feet and now he became my boss! It is just to show how he was so caught up wanting to become chief engineer.</span><br/><br/><span>He was also given to all vices, he was drinking so much that his liver is spoiled; he developed jaundice, which developed into liver sclerosis and hewent in to deep coma. In the hospital ICU he was connected to heart lung machines. The doctors lost hope and were waiting for the final moments. We colleagues were talking turns to be by his bed side.</span><br/><br/><span>It is said light glows big before dying, the same way a person also gets a glow of life before finally departing. So after ten days that evening I saw an activity in him indicating coming in to slight consciousness, I immediately held his hand, pressed it and wanted to give positive suggestion, “Sir, you will become alright, things are fine! In a day or two we will go from this hospital”.</span><br/><br/><span>He gently open his eyes halfway, requested me feebly, “Raghuram, save me, I want to become chief engineer!”</span><br/><br/><span>I wondered, how deep this desire wanting to become chief engineer has gone into him to subconscious levels. Ten days of deep coma did not erase this desire. I am sure it has gone into subtler layers, which cannot be destroyed by death. So I was feeling these desires will hang on to his soul and will become the bondage for the next birth and then struggle continues.</span><br/><br/><span>That’s why our people used to say, it is the deep rooted desire which is the bondage for our rebirth.</span><br/><br/><span>So the incidents unchecked become the habits, not controlled become vasanas. When they percolate deep into subconscious levels or genetic levels these vasanas become samskaras. So our vritties or disturbances and disharmony can be at the habit level or may be at samskara level, we may not know about them. One happy note about this way of looking is, if a habit can be reversed by a few days of counter habit, vasanas can be reversed by conscious practice of counter habit for a longer period of time. Samskaras can also be reversed by working for a longer period of time. Deep rooted samskaras or the nature of anger, hatred, fears, phobias or even physiological dysfunctions can be reversed by long and conscious practices of the counter practices.</span><br/><br/><span>When tension, speed, agitation etc., are habits or vasanas and samskaras, practice of asanas, pranayama, meditation etc., can help to reverse them. If tension, speed, agitation are percolated at samskara level resulting in to hypertension, diabetes etc., the practices of yoga for sufficient period of time consciously can reverse and health can be restored.</span><br/><br/><span>In Sanskrit health is called “Swastha” (swa=self; stha=being) which means “being in self” and sickness is called as “Aswastha” which means “being away from self”. Tension, speed etc., are being away from self therefore they are the cause for sickness. When you practice yoga, conscious practice of slowness, calmness and peace are swastha, which is the state of bliss, and the nature of all of us.</span><br/><br/><span>-to be continued&hellip;</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>If you look at this situation of tension, speed etc., they are qualities of “doing”.

The body continues to be tensed; the prana continues to be fast. The blood pressure, which has gone up, wants to comedown but before it comes down, you push it again and again. So the blood pressure stays up. It becomes a habit.</span><br/><br/><span>Thus the episodes of tension, speed etc., having repeatedly occurred become a habit. So all these altered changes are our habits, and the habit can be reversed by consciously working with a counter habit. If the tension has been our habit formed unconsciously driven by circumstances, yoga is the counter habit consciously practiced. Relaxation in doing asanas should be a conscious reversal. Similarly at the prana level, pranayama is the conscious reversal of speed into slowness. Meditation is a conscious process to calming down the mind.</span><br/><br/><span>If we don’t correct at the habit level, it percolates deep into us forming “vasanas”. Vasanas are hardened habits. Habits are superficial and they have not yet interfered with the pathology, but the vasanas are percolated into pathology. At the habit level, it is simple restlessness. Given an avenue, the habit would like to take over, but it does not disturb the physiology. But when the habit becomes a vasana, it interferes with our physiological function. It becomes pathological</span><br/><br/><span>People have the habit of drinking tea or coffee. It is habit acquired from outside. It has not come from birth, it is acquired from the world outside. When the tea drinking is at the habit level, if we don’t get tea, you feel little restless and uneasy. When it becomes vasana, it becomes pathological. It stars interfering with the natural body function. When the habit of drinking tea or coffee reaches the level of vasana, then without that one starts getting headache or one might not have his normal body functions in the morning. It means our body becomes a slave to the vasanas.</span><br/><br/><span>Our name, our religious faiths etc., they all percolate at the vasana level, which is definitely deeper than the conscious level, immediate unconscious level, like sleep. That’s why when a group of persons are sleeping along with you, and if your name is called out you will respond because only you hear and others may not respond for your name. That shows your name has gone into ‘sleep conscious level’. The same way in the dream state your religion does not change, a Hindu is still a Hindu, a Muslim is a Muslim; a politician is still a politician.</span><br/><br/><span>When not corrected at the vasana level, the same habits percolate deep in our body, affecting even the genetic level, which is called samskaras.</span><br/><br/><span>At the samskara level, they are at much deeper subconscious levels, and they percolate life after life. Anger, hatred, fear etc., all can percolate in us from life after life.</span><br/><br/><span>When I first joined in my job, I was still in my probation; I had a super boss, a superintending engineer, deeply wanting to become chief engineer. Just to illustrate how passionately he was nurturing the desire to become chief engineer, every morning when he came to the office, the first thing he said is that he had a dream last night where he became a chief engineer. Any temple he comes across, he goes to pray to god to make him chief engineer. The moment he sees any person with an ochre robe or otherwise religious looking, he falls at his feet and begs them to please bless him to become chief engineer.</span><br/><br/><span>One day I came to the office late, rushed into the elevator, and found ,this super boss in the elevator. Smilingly I said good morning. The elevator closed with only two of us in and started moving to the fifth floor. Like lightening, I found in a moment, this man touching my feet and saying “Raghuram, bless me; I have become chief engineer”. I said, “Sir, what is this I am so junior and you are senior, how I can bless you”. He replied “I heard people talking that you also do meditation, maybe you have powers so please bless me”. I blushed and said, “Sir, what if people see us. He replied “that’s’ why I am at your feet in the lift”.</span><br/><br/><span>And the lift stopped at the fifth floor and we both came out. At once he stated in strong tone, “Raghuram, why are you late?” I was surprised! Moments back he was at my feet and now he became my boss! It is just to show how he was so caught up wanting to become chief engineer.</span><br/><br/><span>He was also given to all vices, he was drinking so much that his liver is spoiled; he developed jaundice, which developed into liver sclerosis and hewent in to deep coma. In the hospital ICU he was connected to heart lung machines. The doctors lost hope and were waiting for the final moments. We colleagues were talking turns to be by his bed side.</span><br/><br/><span>It is said light glows big before dying, the same way a person also gets a glow of life before finally departing. So after ten days that evening I saw an activity in him indicating coming in to slight consciousness, I immediately held his hand, pressed it and wanted to give positive suggestion, “Sir, you will become alright, things are fine! In a day or two we will go from this hospital”.</span><br/><br/><span>He gently open his eyes halfway, requested me feebly, “Raghuram, save me, I want to become chief engineer!”</span><br/><br/><span>I wondered, how deep this desire wanting to become chief engineer has gone into him to subconscious levels. Ten days of deep coma did not erase this desire. I am sure it has gone into subtler layers, which cannot be destroyed by death. So I was feeling these desires will hang on to his soul and will become the bondage for the next birth and then struggle continues.</span><br/><br/><span>That’s why our people used to say, it is the deep rooted desire which is the bondage for our rebirth.</span><br/><br/><span>So the incidents unchecked become the habits, not controlled become vasanas. When they percolate deep into subconscious levels or genetic levels these vasanas become samskaras. So our vritties or disturbances and disharmony can be at the habit level or may be at samskara level, we may not know about them. One happy note about this way of looking is, if a habit can be reversed by a few days of counter habit, vasanas can be reversed by conscious practice of counter habit for a longer period of time. Samskaras can also be reversed by working for a longer period of time. Deep rooted samskaras or the nature of anger, hatred, fears, phobias or even physiological dysfunctions can be reversed by long and conscious practices of the counter practices.</span><br/><br/><span>When tension, speed, agitation etc., are habits or vasanas and samskaras, practice of asanas, pranayama, meditation etc., can help to reverse them. If tension, speed, agitation are percolated at samskara level resulting in to hypertension, diabetes etc., the practices of yoga for sufficient period of time consciously can reverse and health can be restored.</span><br/><br/><span>In Sanskrit health is called “Swastha” (swa=self; stha=being) which means “being in self” and sickness is called as “Aswastha” which means “being away from self”. Tension, speed etc., are being away from self therefore they are the cause for sickness. When you practice yoga, conscious practice of slowness, calmness and peace are swastha, which is the state of bliss, and the nature of all of us.</span><br/><br/><span>-to be continued&hellip;</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"PANCA KOSA -6- Being versus Doing","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2006-05-26T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2006-05-26T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-05-26T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":169,"uuid":"2dabf304-a4b2-469d-93e5-f0545058764a","title":"PANCA KOSA -5- Nature of Bliss","slug":"panca-kosa-5-nature-of-bliss","markdown":"<p><span>What is this natural state of bliss?</span><br/><br/><span>In this creation of God, the nature of the fish is the swim in water, and the fish swims in the water.

It is in this epic that we see a story that exemplifies the philosophy of knowledge: knowledge does not belong to you, rather you belong to knowledge. When we realize this concept, we do not become arrogant of our knowledge, and thus, we begin to realize the spiritual dimension of knowledge. Knowledge may be of the world, but the wisdom that we belong to the knowledge and not visa versa, is spiritual knowledge. Let us further explore this concept through a story found in the Mahabharata.</span><br/><br/><span>Upon the recommendation of Bhishma, King Dritarastra appointed Drona as the teacher of both the Kaurvas and Pandavas. Drona’s son, Ashwatthama, is also learning under the tutelage of his father since he is around the same age as the others. One of the Pandava brothers is Arjuna, a great archer.</span><br/><br/><span>One day, while being trained, Ashwatthama approaches his father, who is also his teacher, and impatiently states, “Father, I heard some people talking and I want to know if it is true.”</span><br/><br/><span>“What is it my dear son?” Drona was concerned about is disturbing his son. Ashwatthama asked, “I heard you are teaching a special archery technique to Arjuna. Is this true?”</span><br/><br/><span>“Yes, my dear son, but why are you asking this?” Drona asked.</span><br/><br/><span>Ashwatthama continued, “Why are you not teaching me this technique? Why are you teaching it to Arjuna?”</span><br/><br/><span>Drona calmly responds with a question, “Who is asking me this question? Are you asking as my son or my student? Please clarify this first.”</span><br/><br/><span>Ashwatthama was surprised by this question. “Of course, I am your son and I am asking. Don’t you love me? Don’t you think that what belongs to you first belongs to your son before it is shared with others? Is this not true father?”</span><br/><br/><span>Drona patiently, yet firmly responds, “My son, I really love you. I love you so much that I live only for your sake. If I ever hear that you have died, I shall die the very next moment.” (During the epic, when the war occurs and Drona hears of his son’s death, that very moment Drona dies)</span><br/><br/><span>“But if you love me so much, why do you not give me the knowledge?” Ashwatthama asks.</span><br/><br/><span>Drona gives his son great wisdom in the context of his answer which is full of love and affection towards him. “My dear son, as you are my son, all of my property and wealth belongs to you. But my knowledge belongs to my student and not to my son. In reality, it is so because the knowledge does not belong to me, I belong to it. By coming to someone, knowledge gives one freedom and happiness. Because knowledge gives all of that, you have to be humble and respectful to the knowledge. Therefore, you belong to the knowledge and not otherwise. I, therefore, belong to the knowledge. The knowledge does not belong to me. Therefore, I have the responsibility towards the knowledge to pass it on to someone who deserves it.”</span><br/><br/><span>Ashwatthama still did not completely understand. He seeks further clarification in this regard, “But I am your student as well. So why do you choose to pass this knowledge on to Arjuna and not me?”</span><br/><br/><span>Drona patiently explained, “The knowledge will only be given to the deserving student and not anyone else.”</span><br/><br/><span>“But how do you say that I am not the deserving student?” Ashwatthama further questioned.</span><br/><br/><span>“My son, the very fact that you are asking this question is evidence that you do not deserve and have not proved your deservedness in the eyes of the teacher. I do not really owe any further explanation. However, out of my compassion for you, I shall answer your question. I shall show you tomorrow, on the exam, that Arjuna is the only deserving student.”</span><br/><br/><span>The next day, Drona gave the exam and proved that Arjuna has been the only student who actually obeys his orders perfectly.</span><br/><br/><span>This is a beautiful incident where has been a great teacher who did not deviate from his Dharma, or duty, as a teacher and did not come under the spell of his attachment to his son. Though Ashwatthama is his son and he loves him absolutely, he could discriminate the difference between his love and his attachment.</span><br/><br/><span>Drona also exhibited that knowledge does not belong to him but he belongs to knowledge and that he must be humble to this knowledge. The stories of the Mahabharata are not just stories giving incidents but they are lessons of a higher and subtler reality told by several characters.

If I ever hear that you have died, I shall die the very next moment.” (During the epic, when the war occurs and Drona hears of his son’s death, that very moment Drona dies)</span><br/><br/><span>“But if you love me so much, why do you not give me the knowledge?” Ashwatthama asks.</span><br/><br/><span>Drona gives his son great wisdom in the context of his answer which is full of love and affection towards him. “My dear son, as you are my son, all of my property and wealth belongs to you. But my knowledge belongs to my student and not to my son. In reality, it is so because the knowledge does not belong to me, I belong to it. By coming to someone, knowledge gives one freedom and happiness. Because knowledge gives all of that, you have to be humble and respectful to the knowledge. Therefore, you belong to the knowledge and not otherwise. I, therefore, belong to the knowledge. The knowledge does not belong to me. Therefore, I have the responsibility towards the knowledge to pass it on to someone who deserves it.”</span><br/><br/><span>Ashwatthama still did not completely understand. He seeks further clarification in this regard, “But I am your student as well. So why do you choose to pass this knowledge on to Arjuna and not me?”</span><br/><br/><span>Drona patiently explained, “The knowledge will only be given to the deserving student and not anyone else.”</span><br/><br/><span>“But how do you say that I am not the deserving student?” Ashwatthama further questioned.</span><br/><br/><span>“My son, the very fact that you are asking this question is evidence that you do not deserve and have not proved your deservedness in the eyes of the teacher. I do not really owe any further explanation. However, out of my compassion for you, I shall answer your question. I shall show you tomorrow, on the exam, that Arjuna is the only deserving student.”</span><br/><br/><span>The next day, Drona gave the exam and proved that Arjuna has been the only student who actually obeys his orders perfectly.</span><br/><br/><span>This is a beautiful incident where has been a great teacher who did not deviate from his Dharma, or duty, as a teacher and did not come under the spell of his attachment to his son. Though Ashwatthama is his son and he loves him absolutely, he could discriminate the difference between his love and his attachment.</span><br/><br/><span>Drona also exhibited that knowledge does not belong to him but he belongs to knowledge and that he must be humble to this knowledge. The stories of the Mahabharata are not just stories giving incidents but they are lessons of a higher and subtler reality told by several characters. It is the story of yoga in practice.</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"An Incident from Mahabharata","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2006-05-21T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2006-05-21T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-05-21T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":172,"uuid":"d8dd8a42-8c04-4a69-911a-3a5c0a78029a","title":"Question on different types of Bhakti","slug":"question-on-different-types-of-bhakti","markdown":"<p><strong>Question:</strong><span> &quot;Thinking of the life of Mira or Prahlad, we see absolute fearlessness(abhayam) and willingness to go through anything for the sake of the love of God. be it drinking poison or sitting in fire.

Can we separate our love from having hatred can we separate our state of Abhaya, which is freedom from fear, from an act that we do out of brain washing and indoctrination. then we can see that there is no room for hatred or anger, because the root cause of anger and hatred is ego or the boundary that we draw. Our ego can manifest in ever so many ways that we create such boundaries and bind us so many ways and become rigid. our land can be boundary our party can be boundary and our religion can be our boundary. these are all various avatars of our ego. what was India before independence. did it not include Karachi Dhaka and even Kabul. have we forgotten the story of Rabindranath tagore Kabulivalla. what is religion.

Who exists beyond mind?</span><br/><br/><span>A very simple observation shows that it is our intellect which gives instructions to the mind. Not only the mind but the instructions of the entire body are from the intellect.</span><br/><br/><span>When you are at a shop buying a pair of items, each costing twenty rupees, and the person in the shop says fifty for two of them. You will at once be alerted and say, “Why fifty? Two of twenty each should only be forty”.</span><br/><br/><span>Who said this? Who directed you to say this? It is our intellectual personality called Vijnanamaya kosa. Vijnana or intellect is the one, which does all the calculations. It is the intellect which says, this is big and this is small. This is okay and this is not okay. It is the intellect which says in a work of engineering what formula should be applied. It is the intellect in the work of medicine, which says what count of blood is normal. So, it is the intellectual personality Vijnanamaya kosa, which not only guides you, but the whole world. When you say you are responsible, it means it is the intellectual personality, Vijnanamaya kosa.</span><br/><br/><span>The whole world goes by Vijnana. If the Vijnana says, ‘Yes’, the world says, ‘yes’. And if the Vijnana says, ‘no’, the world says, ‘no’. Vijnana saying means intellectuals saying. Earlier intellectuals said that cholesterol is bad for body and the ghee, butter, adds to cholesterol. Therefore, ghee is bad. Everybody stopped eating ghee. Recently, other intellectuals said the body needs what is called good cholesterol and ghee is of the good cholesterol variety. Once again, people started eating ghee.</span><br/><br/><span>At the individual level, it is the intellect which is responsible for all the activities. That is why we identify ourselves with the intellectual personality. If my intellect is trained in medicine, I am a doctor; if my intellect is trained in science, I am a scientist; and in architecture I am an architect. If my intellect is trained to lie I am lawyer; if I have no intellect I am a politician! We thus identified ourselves with intellectual personality as the Vijnanamaya kosa.</span><br/><br/><span>The student is excited, rushes back to the teacher, and says with joy, “I am the Vijnanamaya kosa, intellectual personality”. The teacher is not yet satisfied, he asks him to go further to investigate.</span><br/><br/><em>Tapasaa Brahma Vigijnasasva.</em><br/><br/><span>The whole world recognizes the intellect as something supreme. All the universities exist to train the intellect. All diplomas, certificates, and convocations are essentially to recognize intellect. A Nobel Prize is for intellectual excellence. It easily looks like the supreme aspect of us and like there can be nothing higher than the intellectual personality! </span><br/><br/><span>How can there be any thing subtler, deeper and nearer to us than the intellect?</span><br/><br/><span>The intellectual personality functions and survives on the natural laws on one end and rules and equations on the other. These are the boundaries. Once there are laws and rules, there is bondage. Therefore the personality, Vijnanamaya kosa, is bound within the laws and equations. There is no freedom at the intellectual level or intellectual personality. When there is bondage of laws and rules, how can there be freedom? And once the freedom is not there where is the happiness? Happiness has to constantly conform to remain within the boundaries, so there is no rest at the Vijnanamaya personality!</span><br/><br/><span>Intellect is important, because it can help a person to fully understand the universe around him/her. This intellect allows us to judge what is right and wrong; okay and not okay; and how to learn from mistakes. The intellectual personality is consistently taking laws and regulations into consideration. Therefore, it cannot be happy and restful. Therefore, one has to withdraw one’s sellf from the intellectual personality and rest in happiness. We do this everyday in our sleep where we shut down the intellect and go to the inner shell where we are happy. </span><br/><br/><span>Thus the teacher asks the student, what are we when we are free from the intellectual personality? What is that which is subtler than the intellectual personality? Is it an experience for all or for only a fortune few who meditate? If it is our nature, it should be there whether we do spiritual sadhana or not. </span><br/><span>It is a very difficult question to answer. But once we begin investigating this, we can see this personality is in our daily activities because it is our inherent nature and that it alone is responsible for all our activities. On a simple observation it appears that the intellect is everything and is guiding our experience. But a more careful study shows that it is not the intellect, but rather, bliss which is propelling all our activities.</span><br/><br/><strong>AANANDAMAYA KOSA:</strong><br/><br/><span>So the natural question of the student is, “How?”</span><br/><br/><span>If I ask my intellect if I should put my hand in the fire, the intellect will respond by saying that the fire will burn you. But the only way that the intellect knows this is through experience or another person’s advice. The intellect says I can only tell you if you put your hand in the fire it burns. And I cannot guide you beyond my preview whether you would like to put in your hand in fire. What we trained the intellect can only guide you in that. The intellect trained in medicine cannot talk about electronics. An intellect trained in electronics cannot talk about surgery of a heart valve. What information you give to the intellect, the intellect can only work within that fold.</span><br/><br/><span>I remember an experience. While I was in high school, I was teaching my younger sister, simple mathematics - ideas about addition and subtraction. She was very intelligent and her grasp was excellent. I was teaching her with simple day to day examples like 10 oranges plus 15 oranges equals 25 oranges; minus 5 oranges is equal to 20 oranges etc. She went for the exam and came back depressed. When I asked what happened, she replied, “The exam was too difficult and had questions that I didn’t know.” When I looked at the exam, I was surprised because it was what we had discussed. I asked her why she felt it was too difficult. She replied promptly, “You taught me orange math, and they give me question about apples”</span><br/><br/><span>What is given to intellect, intellect is bound within that, intellect does not go beyond.</span><br/><br/><span>I have a friend in Texas in a small town. Coming from Bangalore, his house is like a small Bangalore with decorations, food, culture, music etc; it was like a mini Bangalore. He has a brilliant child 6 year old, who is fond of any thing of from Bangalore. Every summer they would come to Bangalore and spend their vacation! The child is very inquisitive. Anything that Dad brings home, he has to rip it open and see. Dad wants to ensure the child does not spoil precious things like a camera, TV etc., so he gave instructions to the child, “These are electronics, so do not touch them.” He cannot play with electronics. The child is very well-behaved. The first day when I went to their house, Dad took me to the house and I was sitting on the couch. The boy was hiding behind the dad looking curiously at the stranger. The dad pulled him forward and said to him, “Do namaste to uncle Raghuram. He is from Bangalore, speaks your language, and you can enjoy his company”. But seeing the glow on the child’s face, the dad thought If he lets the child loose, he will jump on me. Not knowing how I would take it, dad cautions the child, “He is from Bangalore all right, but don’t touch him. Ok?”</span><br/><br/><span>The child whispered in dad’s ears about me, “Is he electronics?”</span><br/><br/><span>Intellect takes what is given to it. Intellect cannot advise whether you should put your hand in the fire or not. So what guides your intellect? It is happiness which decides. There is no happiness in burning our hand, so we don’t put our hand in fire. It is not because the fire burns.</span><br/><br/><span>One might raise a question, “Why should we make such a hair splitting distinction between intellect and bliss or happiness”? </span><br/><br/><span>Take the example of a smoker. He smokes not because his intellect is telling him to smoke. No, his intellect is also telling him smoking is bad for his health. But he still continues to smoke. Why? A friend of mine, a brilliant engineer, took up smoking, and I wanted to advise him against smoking. An engineer, a brilliant scientific mind, can easily be convinced with numbers and statistics. So I asked him, why you do you smoke when 59% of lung cancer patients are smokers?</span><br/><span>He replied to me, “Where have you been Raghuram? The latest statistics show it is not 59%, it is 86%.” I was speechless. If he knows this, why does he go on smoking? </span><br/><br/><span>When I asked him repeatedly, he felt as though I was nagging him. Any good advice repeated few times will be nagging so one as to be careful!</span><br/><br/><span>He felt nagged and countered me with a question, “Raghuram you advise me not to smoke. Did you ever smoke?” Nobody had ever asked me this question. I mumbled saying, “Well, no, I never smoked”. Like an arrow his comment came, “That’s why you advise me not to smoke. You don’t know the joy of smoking”.</span><br/><br/><span>It is therefore not the intellect which guides us but it is the happiness, joy which guides us. All our actions are because of happiness. Smoking we do for the sake of happiness. We eat because it gives us happiness. All of our activities are done for the sake of happiness, consciously and unconsciously. Even in sleep, in the unconscious state, it is this happiness which is responsible for even simple activities, like rolling on the bed unconsciously.</span><br/><br/><span>Consciously or unconsciously we are guided by happiness alone. Nobody else or nothing from outside is guiding us. It is this happiness that is there within us, which is our nature, and which is guiding us. One slight objection could be, I see every activity which gives happiness has an object or situation or recognition behind but how can we say happiness is our nature. It appears contradictory to our experience.</span><br/><br/><span>Our experience is that the object outside gives us the experience of happiness. And you seem to suggest happiness is our nature.</span><br/><br/><span>To answer this objection, observe your state of deep sleep experience. We all experiencer joyfulness in deep sleep. We are happy and in that state without the need of external objects. The reporter of the deep sleep is absent but the experiencer is there in deep sleep. That is the reason why when we getup, we indicate that we had very good sleep. It is the reporter who was absent in deep sleep and he comes back when you wake up. It was pure bliss; it indicates that we are happy even though when there is no external object to give us happiness. Even the most cherished object of your choice like a music or dance etc. can not enter into your deep sleep state. When somebody plays your favorite song when you are in deep sleep, you tell them to turn it off so you can sleep. </span><br/><br/><span>In this deep sleep, we have experienced happiness without the interference of external objects. This is where we begin touching the state of happiness within. Hence, it is said that happiness lies within. It is responsible for all of your activities. When there is happiness or joy independent of the influence of external objects, it is referred to as bliss. Both happiness and bliss are the same in regards to the experience felt. But bliss is independent of objects. This bliss is our innate nature. </span><br/><br/><span>The source of happiness, since it is our nature, is our soul and it flies on the wings of joy on one side and ecstasy on other. It is beyond the intellectual boundaries. That is why both, a wise man and a stupid man, can both be equally happy. The happiness experience does not depend on the pairs of opposites. For example, both silence and noise can give us happiness and good and bad can give us happiness. Deep within our nature, or soul and the actual self, is happiness</span><br/><br/><span>Once the student knew that his nature is bliss after his thorough investigations, he is still confused, “Why am I so far away from happiness, when my very nature is happiness?” With this realization that he is bliss, he established himself in it.</span><br/><br/><span>The Upanishad states that not only the student establishes in bliss, but any person who recognizes that his nature is bliss and happiness will automatically establish themselves in bliss. </span><br/><br/><span>It is thoroughly convincing to know that our nature is bliss and all other kosas are out side of the bliss. In order to make one understand this I have not taken any example from any saints sitting in the forest of the Himalayas and meditating and found he has all these personalities. Instead, I quoted the examples from simple day to day experiences of life. The Upanishad asks, are you convinced about it. The student today says, “Yes, I suppose.” </span><br/><br/><span>But once we are convinced we are in big trouble!</span><br/><br/><span>to be continued&hellip;</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Who is there? Who exists beyond mind?</span><br/><br/><span>A very simple observation shows that it is our intellect which gives instructions to the mind. Not only the mind but the instructions of the entire body are from the intellect.</span><br/><br/><span>When you are at a shop buying a pair of items, each costing twenty rupees, and the person in the shop says fifty for two of them. You will at once be alerted and say, “Why fifty? Two of twenty each should only be forty”.</span><br/><br/><span>Who said this? Who directed you to say this? It is our intellectual personality called Vijnanamaya kosa. Vijnana or intellect is the one, which does all the calculations. It is the intellect which says, this is big and this is small. This is okay and this is not okay. It is the intellect which says in a work of engineering what formula should be applied. It is the intellect in the work of medicine, which says what count of blood is normal. So, it is the intellectual personality Vijnanamaya kosa, which not only guides you, but the whole world. When you say you are responsible, it means it is the intellectual personality, Vijnanamaya kosa.</span><br/><br/><span>The whole world goes by Vijnana. If the Vijnana says, ‘Yes’, the world says, ‘yes’. And if the Vijnana says, ‘no’, the world says, ‘no’. Vijnana saying means intellectuals saying. Earlier intellectuals said that cholesterol is bad for body and the ghee, butter, adds to cholesterol. Therefore, ghee is bad. Everybody stopped eating ghee. Recently, other intellectuals said the body needs what is called good cholesterol and ghee is of the good cholesterol variety. Once again, people started eating ghee.</span><br/><br/><span>At the individual level, it is the intellect which is responsible for all the activities. That is why we identify ourselves with the intellectual personality. If my intellect is trained in medicine, I am a doctor; if my intellect is trained in science, I am a scientist; and in architecture I am an architect. If my intellect is trained to lie I am lawyer; if I have no intellect I am a politician! We thus identified ourselves with intellectual personality as the Vijnanamaya kosa.</span><br/><br/><span>The student is excited, rushes back to the teacher, and says with joy, “I am the Vijnanamaya kosa, intellectual personality”. The teacher is not yet satisfied, he asks him to go further to investigate.</span><br/><br/><em>Tapasaa Brahma Vigijnasasva.</em><br/><br/><span>The whole world recognizes the intellect as something supreme. All the universities exist to train the intellect. All diplomas, certificates, and convocations are essentially to recognize intellect. A Nobel Prize is for intellectual excellence. It easily looks like the supreme aspect of us and like there can be nothing higher than the intellectual personality! </span><br/><br/><span>How can there be any thing subtler, deeper and nearer to us than the intellect?</span><br/><br/><span>The intellectual personality functions and survives on the natural laws on one end and rules and equations on the other. These are the boundaries. Once there are laws and rules, there is bondage. Therefore the personality, Vijnanamaya kosa, is bound within the laws and equations. There is no freedom at the intellectual level or intellectual personality. When there is bondage of laws and rules, how can there be freedom? And once the freedom is not there where is the happiness? Happiness has to constantly conform to remain within the boundaries, so there is no rest at the Vijnanamaya personality!</span><br/><br/><span>Intellect is important, because it can help a person to fully understand the universe around him/her. This intellect allows us to judge what is right and wrong; okay and not okay; and how to learn from mistakes. The intellectual personality is consistently taking laws and regulations into consideration. Therefore, it cannot be happy and restful. Therefore, one has to withdraw one’s sellf from the intellectual personality and rest in happiness. We do this everyday in our sleep where we shut down the intellect and go to the inner shell where we are happy. </span><br/><br/><span>Thus the teacher asks the student, what are we when we are free from the intellectual personality? What is that which is subtler than the intellectual personality? Is it an experience for all or for only a fortune few who meditate? If it is our nature, it should be there whether we do spiritual sadhana or not. </span><br/><span>It is a very difficult question to answer. But once we begin investigating this, we can see this personality is in our daily activities because it is our inherent nature and that it alone is responsible for all our activities. On a simple observation it appears that the intellect is everything and is guiding our experience. But a more careful study shows that it is not the intellect, but rather, bliss which is propelling all our activities.</span><br/><br/><strong>AANANDAMAYA KOSA:</strong><br/><br/><span>So the natural question of the student is, “How?”</span><br/><br/><span>If I ask my intellect if I should put my hand in the fire, the intellect will respond by saying that the fire will burn you. But the only way that the intellect knows this is through experience or another person’s advice. The intellect says I can only tell you if you put your hand in the fire it burns. And I cannot guide you beyond my preview whether you would like to put in your hand in fire. What we trained the intellect can only guide you in that. The intellect trained in medicine cannot talk about electronics. An intellect trained in electronics cannot talk about surgery of a heart valve. What information you give to the intellect, the intellect can only work within that fold.</span><br/><br/><span>I remember an experience. While I was in high school, I was teaching my younger sister, simple mathematics - ideas about addition and subtraction. She was very intelligent and her grasp was excellent. I was teaching her with simple day to day examples like 10 oranges plus 15 oranges equals 25 oranges; minus 5 oranges is equal to 20 oranges etc. She went for the exam and came back depressed. When I asked what happened, she replied, “The exam was too difficult and had questions that I didn’t know.” When I looked at the exam, I was surprised because it was what we had discussed. I asked her why she felt it was too difficult. She replied promptly, “You taught me orange math, and they give me question about apples”</span><br/><br/><span>What is given to intellect, intellect is bound within that, intellect does not go beyond.</span><br/><br/><span>I have a friend in Texas in a small town. Coming from Bangalore, his house is like a small Bangalore with decorations, food, culture, music etc; it was like a mini Bangalore. He has a brilliant child 6 year old, who is fond of any thing of from Bangalore. Every summer they would come to Bangalore and spend their vacation! The child is very inquisitive. Anything that Dad brings home, he has to rip it open and see. Dad wants to ensure the child does not spoil precious things like a camera, TV etc., so he gave instructions to the child, “These are electronics, so do not touch them.” He cannot play with electronics. The child is very well-behaved. The first day when I went to their house, Dad took me to the house and I was sitting on the couch. The boy was hiding behind the dad looking curiously at the stranger. The dad pulled him forward and said to him, “Do namaste to uncle Raghuram. He is from Bangalore, speaks your language, and you can enjoy his company”. But seeing the glow on the child’s face, the dad thought If he lets the child loose, he will jump on me. Not knowing how I would take it, dad cautions the child, “He is from Bangalore all right, but don’t touch him. Ok?”</span><br/><br/><span>The child whispered in dad’s ears about me, “Is he electronics?”</span><br/><br/><span>Intellect takes what is given to it.

The eyes see because of Prana, the ears hear because of Prana, the legs can walk because of Prana, the mouth can talk because of Prana. Therefore we are Pranamaya Kosa. When Prana is not there, we are not there. Even in our bodies, when there is no life force, we are not affected. For example, there is no Prana in our hair or nails so when we cut them, we do not feel pain. But see how much time and money we spend to maintain the hair and nails where we are not there! It is no better than house keeping.</span><br/><br/><span>When Mullah Nasiruddin got off at Bangalore railway station he found a foot path vendor selling some herbal oil for remarkable hair growth.

The student thus discovers the first layer of existence, Annamaya Kosa.</span><br/><br/><span>He explains to the teacher that he is the physical, or physiological personality, consisting of various limbs, organs, etc. He notes that as long as this physical body is there, so is he. And the moment the physical body is gone, so is he.</span><br/><br/><span>The physical body is what we consider we are, and therefore we care so much for this body. There is so much attraction for this physical body as it is the source of glamour, so we spend most of our time and energy focused on this body and often feel it is the most important thing in our lives.</span><br/><br/><span>The teacher understands his quick conclusion, and asks the student to further investigate this answer, indicating this not untrue, but needs deeper consideration. The student further researches this question and comes back to the teacher with another answer.</span><br/><br/><strong>Pranamaya Kosa:</strong><br/><br/><span>The student says, “I am the Pranamaya Kosa, or the life force, which is spread through out the physical body and is responsible for all its functions and activity. As long as there is a life force, I exist and the moment the life force is gone, so am I.</span><br/><br/><span>The student noticed that the body does not function by itself. He may have come across a dead body which people where mourning for. He inquired as to why they were crying. The answer they gave was that the Prana, life force, has gone so he is no longer alive. The physical body was still there, but the Prana was not.</span><br/><br/><span>Only when there is Prana, the life force, exists, does the body function. The eyes see because of Prana, the ears hear because of Prana, the legs can walk because of Prana, the mouth can talk because of Prana. Therefore we are Pranamaya Kosa. When Prana is not there, we are not there. Even in our bodies, when there is no life force, we are not affected. For example, there is no Prana in our hair or nails so when we cut them, we do not feel pain. But see how much time and money we spend to maintain the hair and nails where we are not there! It is no better than house keeping.</span><br/><br/><span>When Mullah Nasiruddin got off at Bangalore railway station he found a foot path vendor selling some herbal oil for remarkable hair growth.

This will bring the alertness at that center. Now after developing inner awareness don’t disturb and just use that awareness to go to deeper relaxation. Once we are aware it automatically takes us to deeper relaxation and we can go to subtle level. This is what people call as kundalini rising.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Another question by the sadhaka was these mantras are in Sanskrit and there are lot of people who practice but they do not know Sanskrit. do they not derive benefit of these practices? It does not matter. Knowing Sanskrit and the meaning and idea behind the practices may help one to develop greater dedication and helps them to practice with more mindfulness! So if some one without knowing the meaning and idea but having mindfulness such a person will get equal or more benefit but a person who has all the knowledge of Sanskrit but has no shraddha or mindfulness he will not be enjoying full benefit in these practices. All these explanations are given to show to the person practicing the Suryanamaskara should be able ot appreciate the great wisdom our sages have used in these practices. Their concern was for elevating the mind of sadhaka towards spiritual peaceful states which in classical terms known as chitta shuddhi.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Raghuram</span></p>\n</div>","html":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>A have received some questions and I will try to answer them in this thought stream.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span>Shri </span><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/profile/17827833\"><span>Bothi</span></a></u><span> wrote:</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>If it is correct what you say here, one should need to know Sanskrit to do Suryanamaskaras and to raise KUNDALINI SHAKTI&hellip;If these MANTRAS are so substantial in acting Suryanamaskaras. , as a result, it seems no way for a person who does not pronounce Sanskrit letters correctly&hellip; On the other hand, as far as I know, KUNDALINI SHAKTI has no relation with mantras at all&hellip;</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Ans: several ways sages thought and formed various aspects of Suryanamaskaras so that they aimed the progress from various angles.

Since the friendship is the basis where intellect is not born it is the position of mooladhara or the base chakra.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hreem ravaye namah swadhisthana</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Ravi = sahasraguna mutsrastunadatte hi rasam ravih; one who is the essence of all elements is absorbed by the stomach and lower abdomen in beings its position is swadhistana, the next chakra.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hroom sooryaya namah manipura</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Surya = constant beholder of good and bad; all seeing; we hold good and bad in our heart center so it denotes the manipura</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hraim bhaanave namah vishuddha</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Bhanu is brightness bhaa is light splendor luster etc. our vishuddha chakra voice whose rightful sound indicates our brightness</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hraum khagaaya namah ajna</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Kha= Sky or space it denotes the space in the mind which is the primordial state so it denotes space between eyes in third eye position</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>6.</span><span> </span></span><span><span>aum hrah pooshne namah sahasrara</span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Pooshnah = Rays of light or radiation or having the radiation of knowledge!</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hraam hiranya garbhaaya namah mooladhara</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Hiranya garbha= golden womb its seat therefore is the lower end of the spine culminating in genital organs</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hreem mareecye namah swadhistana</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>mareechi = a particle of light and energy which is from the abdominal region</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hroom aadityaaya namah manipura</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Aaditya = A son of aditi divinity in general; all samskaras or impressions of last life or lives is the</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hraim savitrye namah vishuddha</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>savitr = generating, producing , yielding which is the function of heart which integrates us inside with out side s</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>11.</span><span> </span><span>Aum hraum arkaya namah ajna</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Arka = a big flash of lightening like the spark of knowledge – intellect in the brain centers of us.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Thus the Suryanamaskara mantras denote the centers systematically.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The mantras such as hraam, hreem etc are known as beeja mantras and as I said earlier ‘h’ alone not a sound it is when you exhale keeping the mouth and air column fully open and then when we say r r r r is not a single sound but a sound of beating or percussion which is combined together with the a,e,i,o etc which when we chant create resonance at the centers in the body. This will bring the alertness at that center. Now after developing inner awareness don’t disturb and just use that awareness to go to deeper relaxation. Once we are aware it automatically takes us to deeper relaxation and we can go to subtle level. This is what people call as kundalini rising.</span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Another question by the sadhaka was these mantras are in Sanskrit and there are lot of people who practice but they do not know Sanskrit. do they not derive benefit of these practices? It does not matter. Knowing Sanskrit and the meaning and idea behind the practices may help one to develop greater dedication and helps them to practice with more mindfulness! So if some one without knowing the meaning and idea but having mindfulness such a person will get equal or more benefit but a person who has all the knowledge of Sanskrit but has no shraddha or mindfulness he will not be enjoying full benefit in these practices. All these explanations are given to show to the person practicing the Suryanamaskara should be able ot appreciate the great wisdom our sages have used in these practices. Their concern was for elevating the mind of sadhaka towards spiritual peaceful states which in classical terms known as chitta shuddhi.</span></p>  \n\n<div>  \n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Raghuram</span></p>  \n</div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Suryanamaskar Questions","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":183,"uuid":"dcc9680a-bf13-4309-b6fb-671d4974d7ce","title":"Suryanamaskara Reg","slug":"suryanamaskara-reg","markdown":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Hiranmayena Patrena Satyasya Apihitam Mukham</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Tatvam Pushan Apavrunu Satya Dharmaya Drustaye.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Like the way the Hiranmayam Jyotirmayam = goldenlooking (covered by light) vassal, covers the salya = aditya mandala = the whole celestial bodies of the outer space, Oh Pushan, the Sun, please (apaavrunu) = uncover for me so that it enables me to see Satya Dharma the truth which will be following the Dharma, righteousness.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This is the fifteenth sloka of Isavasya Upanishad of Sukla Yajur Veda. This sloka has been adapted widely as a preyar for Sun god before we practice the Sun postures because in addition to the prayer of sun it has a very important philosophical message. Here the prayer is not for any material gains but prays sun god for the knowledge of the truth and also for the ‘will’ to practice that truth in all situations.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Sun reveals us the reality and without the sun we are in darkness; we can not see the things around, the moment sun rises on the horizon all the objects become clear in their true form, at once. With the sun rise the life will start, activities take place, energization happens. This Sun is the cause for revealing the truth of the nature, he is the cause for manifestation of activity and also he integrates the whole creation according to their nature (Dharma).</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>You can never imagine the world without Sun. Medical studies show in the parts of the globe where they have large spans of night or darkness – namely the countries near poles, when the sun does not appear for long period of time there is high incidence of depression in people. When Sun is absent even animals and plants also go into hibernation or suffocation. Life becomes impossible without sun. Therefore sun is life giver for us.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>You can see all objects under sun light but most interesting thing is all the celestial objects like the stars and the planets, milky ways and star clusters, all of them go into hiding the moment sun rises. They are there but they become invisible the moment sun rise occurs. The beautiful details that you perceive in the darkness of the sky, all the treasure that is there which the fascinating universe is and in front of that sight of the celestial objects, the details that you see on the earth are absolutely trivial and insignificant! But sun does hide the sight of the universe and brings the picture of the world in front of us!</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The sky that you see in the night is the real or true picture of the universe. The light is in the form of small little tiny dots which are separated by huge space of darkness. Though proportionately the darkness is several billion times greater than the light even then strangely we feel the light is more than the darkness. That way light gives illusion. The light misleads us! The sun which rises in the sky not only takes away the details in the sky like stars and planets. But you can not even see the sun. You will be blinded and your eyes will be damaged. The light which is supposed to give us sight takes away our vision – and blinds us. Isn’t this is very strange?</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Especially when you come out of a cinema theatre or a dark studio, you find that your eyes are blinded not because of the darkness but because of the light outside. Your eyes are adjusted to darkness or very negligible light, and when you come from the darkness into light, your eyes will be blinded for some time.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>If the outside is not visible because of lack of light all that we need to do is to open the flash light so that that it will light up and will enable us to see things clearly. But in the case of blindness we experience when we come out of the theatre, that blindness is caused by the light. If light itself blinds you what can help us to come out of such blindness? In addition, if you try to force your eyes to see in that light, it is not only impossible to see but your eyes will be permanently damaged. The only solution at that time is, don’t fight with that light; don’t fight with your eyes and the brain centers. Close your eyes relax and open it slowly, little by little. Try to slowly assimilate the light after some time your eyes will get adjusted. Respect the light, respect the sun and approach it with very higher degree of humbleness and gentleness.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This analogy has been very effectively used for knowledge by the Upanisadic sage. Sun is also known as “Arya” which in other wards is the respectful address for somebody who is wize, who is elevated spiritually and who can help on with knowledge. Therefore sun is depicting knowledge. This knowledge helps us to understand things around us. With such an understanding we start seeing things clearly. Confusion will be shattered fear will be resolved. The light of the knowledge removes the darkness of ignorance.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Knowledge takes away our fear and confusion, knowledge open the vision of the world for us, knowledge is giving us an opportunity if unravel the secrets of the creation. All this technological developments and increase in comforts in the life have been possible because of this knowledge. This small little tiny knowledge can give us so much. One can imagine the vast knowledge that is available and this knowledge keep on growing with the passage of time. Knowledge is infinite. That is why it is said that the more we know we will come to understand how much we really do not know. In fact that is the true learning where it gives us an idea how much we do not know. Knowledge is the one ultimately which gives us peace and harmony.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>From Prashanti Kutiram our residential campus, a couple was posted as yoga teachers in Indonesia. Before going to Indonesia they came to me and asked that they have one more month to improve their knowledge before they actually take the flight to Jakarta. They said, they can perform few postures, do some Pranayama and can give instruction for various meditation aspects of yoga. But they expressed that they are not confident enough to give lectures on philosophy of yoga. So they requested if I can give them few talks on the philosophy of yoga. So for a small group which included them too I was giving every day two to three hours of talk for next thirty days. Listening to the whole series very attentively at the end of the series, they touched my feet with tears of humility in their eyes and they said “Raghuramji, you are international yoga teacher and we are also going internationally to teach yoga. But you have opened our eyes. We realized after listening to the talks how much we do not know”. Thus, knowledge is that which gives us humility.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Humility is the true litmus test to see whether the knowledge has made you a wise person, or not. Wisdom and arrogance do not go together. When one becomes humble with knowledge then knowledge has served its purpose of transforming one and making him a different person.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>A knowledge which does not transform you did not really enter into you. But you may remember it very clearly you may quote from the scriptures. Such knowledge has only become like an addition – or like an attachment to you. All such knowledge which forms our addition becomes our “ego”, which is very dangerous. The knowledge which is light removes our blindness but a knowledge which becomes our ego and the ego of knowledge blinds us further like the way light makes us blind when we come out of a theater. Knowledge which does not transform us becomes burden (of knowledge). This burden of the knowledge gravitates us more and more towards material gains such as name fame, popularity praises and honors, position and authority. They all appear to be good and real but that is how our eyes are blinded. If the eyes are blinded by darkness or ignorance knowledge can help us to come out of that blindness. If we are blinded by knowledge itself, then what else can help us to come out of that darkness, it is like we give a medicine for killing unwanted bacteria but the bacteria within us is using the medicine itself for its growth then we will be in greater trouble. Similarly light is supposed to give us clarity but we are blinded by the light itself. In the same way if knowledge which is supposed to make us humble, will become our arrogance, then what can save us, you will not be able have any knowledge which can save you like the way. When your eyes are blinded by light no other light can help us.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This is the difference between a scholar [pundit] and a sadhaka [spiritual seeker]. A scholar has arrogance of knowledge and a seeker has humility because of knowledge. A scholar feels he can intellectually solve all issues. On the other hand a sadhaka will be prayerful. Prayer really means a heart to heart talk with divinity that I am nothing and you are everything. I am ignorant and you are knowledge. All my knowledge belongs to you rather knowledge does not belong to me but I belong to knowledge. When we surrender our ego completely in humbleness, what god shows us, leads us is the path of truth in the way of righteousness.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>A child while walking on the sand said to god, “I saw behind me four foot prints while walking. And I felt assured that you are walking with me because I thought the other two foot prints belong to you. But now I don’t see the foot prints, I am worried where did you go, leaving me alone?”</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>God replied her “don’t worry when you don’t see the two extra foot prints it is only because I am carrying you and the foot prints you see are mine.”</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Humbleness, innocence, wisdom, and the path of truth and righteousness, all of them go hand in hand one helping the other. In humility the sage prays Oh God Pushan, the nourisher, Lord Surya, I do not see but you show me.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Of the various forms of arrogance than arrogance of knowledge is most difficult to conquer. The arrogance of beauty lives for few years of youth, to preserve arrogance of wealth one has to work hard, and that arrogance gathers people who are only greedy. So all other arrogances are associated with some thing which will make you realize that it is short lived where as the arrogance of knowledge is some thing which will be most difficult to come out of it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>A humble posture and a prayerful mood at once makes one slow contemplative, gives due consideration for others view point, appreciates others way of looking and in addition it provides one an opportunity not to react but to respond suitably. With humbleness one will come to exercise the idea it is futile to react but to make one to understand is the only issue and therefore who is humble will not react but to properly respond. Swami Vivekananda said self confidence is often mistaken as arrogance and humbleness for weakness. Spiritual way is to be humble which is born out of knowledge and strength and not out of weakness.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This is a mantra to make us feel and experience that it is god’s work going on and not ours. He is the knowledge and we belong to knowledge and not otherwise – not the knowledge belongs to us. Utilize the knowledge and don’t misuse this knowledge.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>When pandavas were in the aranyavasa [the life of forest] during that timeKrishna convinces Arjuna not to waste time but to go to earn special weapons powered by Mantra Shakti, the power of mind. Arjuna returns with most powerful weapon called the Pashupatastra. When he told others about his achievement they asked him to demonstrate it! Arjuna was about to charge this and was about to utter the necessary mantras. Immediately the celestial voice told them that these are very special gifts and be humble to this knowledge of the weapon and not to use it for entertainment and for showing off. Utilize the power only when it is very much necessary and for the good of the mankind. Same way the arrogance of knowledge will be manifesting in the form of misuse of knowledge and humility of knowledge will make us not to exhibit. We can come across talks of some people the purpose of such talks is to show how much the speaker knows but the right way of talk takes care of the listeners and the need for their learning. I always found Prof. Sastry would always use such simple language though he has wealth of scriptural knowledge in his memory. He used to use the knowledge which is required to convince the listener but not to show his erudition.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Let this mantra from Isavasya Upanishad remind us this valuable concept every day when we chant this mantra before doing suryanamaskaras.</span></span></p>","html":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Hiranmayena Patrena Satyasya Apihitam Mukham</span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Tatvam Pushan Apavrunu Satya Dharmaya Drustaye.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Like the way the Hiranmayam Jyotirmayam = goldenlooking (covered by light) vassal, covers the salya = aditya mandala = the whole celestial bodies of the outer space, Oh Pushan, the Sun, please (apaavrunu) = uncover for me so that it enables me to see Satya Dharma the truth which will be following the Dharma, righteousness.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>This is the fifteenth sloka of Isavasya Upanishad of Sukla Yajur Veda.

He used to use the knowledge which is required to convince the listener but not to show his erudition.</span></span></p>  \n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Let this mantra from Isavasya Upanishad remind us this valuable concept every day when we chant this mantra before doing suryanamaskaras.</span></span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Suryanamaskara Reg","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2006-02-10T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":184,"uuid":"a64f78b2-af4c-47b8-b510-3bfe7fd51992","title":"Kundalini and Suryanamaskaras","slug":"kundalini-and-suryanamaskaras","markdown":"<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>Before doing suryanamaskaras as I said earlier the tradition is to say the set of mantras which are said in one of the three ways.

It is the first one that really approves Karma Yoga. And the Bhagavad-Gita elaborately talks about Karma Yoga. “Karma” means “work”; and “yoga” means “peace of mind”. So karma yoga is the methodology by which the work we do can take us to peace of mind. But karma is also used for a different meaning. People also refer to karma basically meaning the past activity we have done and its effect; to say that something is karmic; like why were you born in Turkey and not in America? It is my karmic aspect. Why do I have to go through the suffering? It is karmic. But when we have a great pleasure and happiness, then it is not karmic. Then we easily say, “I’ve struggled hard! I struggled and earned and put all the effort in that work”. Whereas when a suffering occurs, when something bad occurs, then we say it is karmic. If you hit somebody, that is your effort. Somebody hits you it is karmic. That is why “karma” is used very conveniently, so we need to understand what karma basically is.</span><br/><span>The second aspect is how karma can give us peace of mind? All agitations, disturbances and the stress all appear because of karma. Activity we feel brings about disturbance. This is the reason when somebody says ‘peace of mind’ people equate it to giving up work. When we simply say that we have to calm down the mind, listeners immediately react saying “if I calm down my mind, how I can work? And how can the work run if we keep quiet?” But that means that karma is the action that is responsible for our problems. And there is no way that I can come out of this activity, so there is no possibility for having peace of mind while I am engaged in work. Do you understand this basically? This is the first secret that Karma Yoga addresses us. It is not the action that is the problem; the problem is something else. Let me give a simple example in the form of a story to illustrate this point.</span><br/><span>The idea of yoga is doing some thing extra ordinary. It should be like some thing challenging. How can simply doing an activity give us the benefits of yoga? Just as doing some humanly impossible rigors of discipline, and torturous practices on he body and mind etc are the ones which gives us the benefits of yoga, no pain no gain situation, how can ordinary activity give us the same benefits?</span><br/><span>Just to show that it is not some thing very non-human you are expected to do a classical story is there.</span><br/><span>Yoga can be in normal work! A saint by name Kaushik was sitting in the forest under a tree meditating deeply. A bird on the braches above was making noise which is natural for the bird. The sage Kaushik got disturbed from his meditation and with anger he looked at the bird with scorching eyes. The very angry looks burnt the bird and it fell dead on the ground.</span><br/><span>Kaushik though felt sorry for the bird, on the other hand he was surprised at the power to burn the bird he acquired through the meditation and was proud too!</span><br/><span>As his meditation got disturbed he found that he was hungry. He walked to a nearby house to ask for food and stood in front of the house and asked for food. It is the tradition those days that it is the responsibility of the society to take care of the needs of a student and a spiritual seeker engaged in meditation. But they are supposed to ask in humility and not in arrogance. When he stood in front of a house and asked for food the house wife came with all respect and wanted to take care of the saint at the door steps. But she found at the same time her husband walks in and she invariable has to take care of his immediate needs as a devout wife. She therefore apologized to the saint saying, “Sir, I would like to take care of you. Please give me some time wait for about ten minutes. Let me take care of him and come back to attend to you”. With he words Kaushik felt irritated, “how can she neglect me in front of her ordinary husband when a great yogi like him who accomplished a great power is standing there. But he controlled himself for the time being and waited. On top of all this she took little more time than he expected. When she came out she sincerely apologized saying, “I am sorry I made you to wait”. But his anger did not subside. She apologized repeatedly. But the arrogance will not allow one to act with compassion.</span><br/><span>When she found he did not change in spite of her repeated requests and also saying that it was no intentional and she could not help the situation, she said, “oh sir, come on give up the angry looks,” and she further added, “I am not the bird to fall pray to your anger like the bird in the forest”.</span><br/><span>He was shocked to hear from her about the bird being burnt because he never expected that any one would know about an incident that happened between him and the bird in the forest where no other person was there. How could he believe she knows about it? How could she know if she does not have any yogic powers? He felt her power must be greater than the power he has to burn a bird just by the heat rays from his angry looks. The moment he realized that she is extra ordinary at once he fell at her feet and prayed her to pardon his ignorance and requested her to tell what kind of yogic practices she does so that she acquired such great powers. She simply smiled and said, “I don’t do any spiritual practices and all that I do is to do my household activity diligently and meticulously”. But he could not believe and thought she is hiding about his practices. She in turn replied, “If you want any more information please go to my guru, his name is Dharma vyaadha and he is in the next town, and find out from him”.</span><br/><span>Kaushik then proceeded to the town in search of the guru she has referred to him. Expecting to see a great spiritual teacher may be having an ashram or a place like that, he looked around in the center of the town. To his surprise he saw no ashram or no sign board of a spiritual master around there but to his surprise he found a butcher shop with the sign board saying ‘Dharmavyaadha meat shop’. He thought it can not be because he is expecting to see a pious man and not a meat selling person.</span><br/><span>As he was hesitating standing there the person in the shop called him, ‘hi gentle man, aren’t you Kaushik and aren’t you the person the lay next village suggested you to meet me. I am the Dharmavyaadha you are looking for.’ Kaushik was totally dumb founded as how could he know what happened between him and the lady next town. But he could not do any thing. He remained as a mute spectator as he found to his surprise the guru is cutting meat and selling meat collecting money and fighting with them for the money! After he finished the work in the shop he counted all the money and took Kaushik wit him to his home. There he took care of his parents joyfully and at the end he asked him, ‘yes gentle man, what I can do for you?’ having seen all the work he is doing yet having such great wisdom, he is now totally surprised and asked him ‘sir, what is the special sadhana or spiritual practice you do so that you are such a great master. Dharmavyaadha replied humbly, ‘all that I do is to do all the duties that I am supposed to do diligently. That is my meditation’.</span><br/><span>Right attitude of work can make it worshipThe moral of the story is that when we are doing the normal day to day work with a special attitude, then the work itself is no inferior to the highest spiritual sadhana. The question now is about the attitude, which can transform our activities into sadhana or spiritual practices!</span><br/><span>Let me give you another anecdote how the attitude in the work can change the complexion of it.</span><br/><span>There is temple that is coming up in a village. And there are several people working in this temple cutting and carving the stones and make some nice, wonderful sculptures. A press reporter goes to these persons and wants to interview. This lady reporter goes and finds a person who is cutting the stones. She asks him, “What are you doing?”</span><br/><span>He replies with lot of anger, “Don’t you see that I am cutting the stone? And it’s a hard stone. Look at my hands! They became red. Beating the stone is like hell. And I would like to find some hole to slip away and rest, but the manager is always looking at me. He knows that I am a person who runs away from work. The whole work is like hell. And on top of it, you come and ask me if the work is really a problem. Cutting stone is really a horrible job. I feel I am cursed to do this. How I wish I could come out of this whole wretched work!” the press person asks the question, “ I see you are cutting the stone, but let me know what is coming up here!” he replies for that saying I don’t know why they are making this road and I am not even interested to know!</span><br/><span>So she goes to the second person and asks him, “What are you doing?” He says, “I’m cutting the stone here. It’s my job. I work for a definite eight hours for ten dollars; I have my wife and children. It’s a burden for me, but I have to take care of them. This is just a duty I am doing.” She asks him, “Do you know what is coming up here?” He says, “Yeah, they say that there is a temple coming. We do all the work for the temple. Whether it is a temple or jail, whatever it is, how it matters, I just do my duty for eight hours and then I go away from here. I have nothing to do with them.”</span><br/><span>Then she goes to the third person. He is also cutting the stones. Then she asks him, “What are you doing?” He answers, “I’m building a temple. In this village, there was no temple for years. Every time there was a temple festival, all these people had to go to the next village. My grandfather tried it for a lifetime to get a temple here. It remained as a dream. My father tried so much, but in his lifetime, it did not happen. It could not have happened in my lifetime as well. By the power and the grace of God, in my lifetime, this temple is coming up. You know, every time I hit the stone I hear such a wonderful music. And look at the way that everything is like a festival ever since that this temple started. This temple brought the whole village together. The temple made this sleepy village into festive mood.” She asks, “How long do you work on this temple?” He says, “Why do you ask how long? As soon as I get up in the morning, I come to this temple, and I start cutting the stones. I eat, drink, and do everything here. Even when I go home in the night, in my sleep, and even in my dream I’m cutting the stones, I dream of this temple. And that’s really enjoyable.”</span><br/><span>“When will you finish this temple work?” He replies, “Why are you asking when we’ll finish? I’m sad that this temple work is finishing and I’ll not have anything to do once this temple is completed. I wish I could continue doing this temple work for a long time, and bring in many more facilities around this temple. It’s a blessing.”</span><br/><span>When you look at the work, all three are doing the same work, but for the first person it is hell, and for the second person, it is a duty. However, for the third person, it is a blessing. If the work has the qualities inherently the goodness and badness, then these three should not have been feeling the same. But that is not the reality. The work itself does not carry these qualities. Then what is that which makes so much of difference? It is not the work which is disturbing our mind but it is some thing subtle.</span><br/><span>Work is external. Attitude is internal. Work belongs to the world. Attitude belongs to you. You cannot change work much because it is in the hands of the world out side! When it happens to change, fine, it happens. But attitude behind the work is in your hands. A certain attitude makes your work miserable and certain other attitude makes it pleasant. Change the attitude, and you will become spiritual. If you do not have the right attitude, you are non-spiritual.</span><br/><span>What you do vs how you do It is not the work that determines whether you are spiritual or not. This point needs to be understood very deeply. In fact, we have such stories in Indian philosophy. A woman can even work as a prostitute, but she can be an extraordinary saint. It is not because of the kind of work she is doing, but the kind of attitude she has. Attitude is in your hands and that is a thing you can change. Nobody can force an attitude on you. People can only influence your attitude, but it is you who decides what attitude you should have. And the right kind of attitude can help you turn it into yoga.</span><br/><span>When you look at it this way, yoga is not doing a few postures. I have seen some people who have a wonderful body, which can bend in so many ways, but they cannot bend their attitude. They can hold their breath until eternity, but they cannot hold their greed, their arrogance etc even to a small degree!</span><br/><span>Now what is yoga and what is not yoga? What appears like yoga may not be yoga. There are many yoga teachers that we come across who do not have the right kind of an attitude, they can bend very well and twist very perfectly yet they are not in true sense yogis because they don’t have right attitude. So karma yoga is not the work outside. It is essentially the attitude behind the work that we do. An attitude that takes toward peace of mind is a healthy attitude. An attitude, which brings about agitations of the mind, is not a yogic attitude. It is a worldly attitude. We have a wonderful ashram Prashanti. You have nice activities going on there. But you may have a few people there who have a wrong attitude. This can happen and does happen in many places. Such a person comes to the doorstep of something which can really help him. Yet he can not take the benefit of it. It is as if you take a spoonful of food and bring it close to your mouth, but you put not in the mouth but in the nose. You suffer. It is not the work that causes suffering but you and you attitude. If a right attitude is there, the work can give you peace of mind. If a right attitude is not there, then the work can cause tension to you. Now, let me give you a few tips as to how we can acquire different attitudes. Once you go to the depths, you have hundreds of things that are there in understanding the karma yoga, but because of the short time maybe we can discuss just a few things.</span><br/><span>If you consider the activity, the first step is that there may be such activities that can harm others, and disturbs others. Then those persons may in revenge disturb me. If I hurt somebody, that person will hurt me back. If I tell lies and misguide somebody, that person might misguide and hurt me. Thereby I suffer, and I say, “Look, I’m suffering!” Then one asks, “Why are you suffering?” “I misguided that man and now he disturbs me.” A simple solution for that thing is, ‘do not cause evil to others! If you do not do evil to others, they will not disturb you. This does not even require spiritual knowledge. It is at a very simple moral level knowledge. At a very simple moral level, it is said, “Do good for others and don’t do bad. Be right; don’t be wrong. Help, don’t hurt”. This does not require the teachings. But there is one subtle point we need to understand here. We should not hurt, not because that person should not be hurt. The hurt that you give, you will get it back. That is one of the physical laws. The physical law says, action and reaction, cause and effect are equal and opposite. The cause and the effect are related. That is what the physical law says. Like in a simple example we see, if I eat bad food, my stomach gets upset. This is a very simple law; it is called a physical law. We understand it in a simple way. This physical law which says, what you do has cause and effect relationship. This is called as ADHI-BHUTA.</span><br/><span>WHAT YOU SOW YOU REAP Whatever that I do, I get the benefit, the result of it. I do bad, so I get a bad result. You can see it right away. If I jump from the eighth floor of the building, I will die or I will break my limbs. I cannot say that I do not know why God is unkind to me. I cannot say my Karma is bad. You cannot blame anybody. You have been wrong. You have got wrong in return. This is a physical law. The physical law, the cause, and the effect are related.</span><br/><span>Logically it is OK. What you sow, you will reap. This is one of the simple things in Karma Yoga. Never do anything bad to anybody. Do not even think bad of anyone. Even that can cause a ricochet effect. Try to do good. But then the next question comes: “I always try to do good, but I get bad.” It is like a person who drives rash on the road, or a person who drives in the wrong direction and has an accident. He has done wrong so he got the result. So simply, do not drive in the wrong way. Do not drive in a rash way, and you will not have an accident. But I am driving in the right direction, and I am not driving rash, yet suddenly someone comes from the opposite direction and in the wrong way and hits me. He is hurt because he is wrong, but why should I suffer a hurt? What mistake have I done? Do you see what it means? I have been good but I receive bad. This is a situation we come across. If it is the good people who suffer then they ask the question, “Why do we suffer in spite of us being good?”</span><br/><span>Now consider this argument. An accident is a physical law. The moment we say it is a physical law; it has a cause and an effect. You are hurt physically, which basically means that there is a cause and effect connection. Accordingly the physical law can have two different dimensions. One dimension is that physically both the vehicles collided and so I am hurt. This does not consider whether you are in right direction or wrong. Physically both vehicles collided and so the accident took place. The second dimension is the subtle one. It is why I should suffer when I have done every thing right. This can be answered as chance which means there is no connection to whether you are right or wrong. It is just a chance. But this explanation can not help us to introspect and also this take apposition that what ever happens is a chance and we have no freedom or a say in such matters. There is another way of looking at. It also has a cause and effect connection because this is also a physical happening and it has to have the cause and result. In other words you created cause some time back and the effect you are receiving now! It can be possible that the cause and the effect may be immediate. But many times it can also be spaced at a long gap, or the cause and the effect may be very far away. The cause and the effect may be distanced so far apart that your perception may not reach. The distance may be both in terms of space and time!</span><br/><span>Our memory and our perception have a certain limit and limitations. We often do not know what we did thirty, forty years ago. In fact, when you look at your own photographs of four years age, you cannot recognize yourself. You start wondering, “Is this me?” and that basically means that our memory does not go that far. ‘Memory does not go far’ does not mean that the events that took place do not exist. The cause and the effect may be beyond your memory, but they are related. If you plant a mango seed, it takes twelve years to get the fruit. You might think that the seed you planted is of a wonderful, beautiful, tasty mango, but at the seed level, you cannot tell the difference. However, twelve years later when the fruit comes, it is a tasteless horrible mango. Then you start saying, “I planted a wonderful mango seed and I got a bad fruit.” How can that be? What you have planted you have got. This law cannot be violated. Just because your memory does not reach that far, it does not mean that the cause is not there. Because it is a physical law it can not have an exception.</span><br/><span>There is a tribe in Africa I heard. Because of some local genetic conditions, this tribe has a memory not longer than six months. They can only think of things that are six months old, and they do not know what happened beyond that. That is as to how the people of this tribe make a connection between sex and childbirth. That connection is a minimum nine months, but since their memory does not go that far, they think that sex is a different part of life and that the child is god-given. It is not because there is a cause and effect relation, but because the cause and the effect are placed beyond the memory. According to Indian philosophy, the effort can bear results not only in this life; it can be after this life. You plant the seeds now, but you reap the fruits later. The “later” may be this life or maybe the next. This is what is called as “karma”. So when we say “karma”, it is not that somebody else is responsible; you are responsible. Then the student asks what the advantage of this hypothesis is. How can we utilize this knowledge? As a result of this knowledge when something bad happens, we do not blame anybody else. We know that it is our own actions, which have given the fruits. Yet I can decide through my actions and attitude what fruits I will have in the future, and not only in the future but in the life after this one. So from now on whatever activity I do, I never plan anything wrong to anybody, so that I shape my future which can be free from agony.</span><br/><span>THE STORY OF BUDDHAOne day Buddha went to a house and begged for some food. This is normal for a sanyasin, who has taken to the spiritual life in India. His requirements are very small: some food and few clothes. They do not have any attachments to anything. Buddha was a big king and he became a sanyasin. And then his requirement is just a morsel of food. Sanyasins do not have houses where food is cooked because it becomes an attachment. So the culture goes that these people go to a house and ask the house lady for food. So Buddha went to a house and asked for food. The lady, respecting the culture, wanted to offer food to him. She opened the door but then she saw a well-built, robust forty-year old man in good health. Obviously she did not recognize him so she at once got annoyed and started shouting at Buddha, “why are you begging food? Can you not earn? Why don’t you work at some place and earn your food? Why should you beg for it? You are a lazy fellow!” After she shouted all that at him, she slammed the door on his face. Buddha’s disciple Ananda heard all this and got angry. He told Buddha, “Why did you keep quiet? Look, you are the king of this place. If she is eating food, it is because of the king’s grace. Why did you allow her to shout at you?” Buddha smiled. “Maybe in some previous life I shouted at her. I’m glad that this debt is cleared now. I don’t want to shout at her now, so that I don’t create a fresh balance. She shouted at me and went back, and now I’m peaceful.”</span><br/><span>Adhi Bhuta,</span><br/><span>Adhi Daiva This basically shows how one’s behavior changes. So karma philosophy is not blaming somebody but seeing how one’s future has been planned. It gives a person a big relief. This is called adhidaiva. So the first one is the adhibhuta, we are responsible for what happens to us because we see immediately or in the immediate future which is in our memory range. The second is adhidaiva, which is beyond our memory, may be this life or may be in the previous but we are responsible. There is a third force called adhyatma. Bhagavad-Gita says that it is our own nature. Adhibhuta is not spiritual; adhidaiva is also not spiritual, because they are cause and effect related, so it is bound, whereas adhyatma is a spiritual force, and that spiritual force is our nature. What is that?</span><br/><span>Even good activity can give miseryEvery activity has these three forces as components. The first component is ‘you do right, and then you get the right back’. Second thing is, ‘you get the benefit, and you get the result from the past, and take it as it comes. Consciously eliminate any activity which can result into bad karma to you’. And the third and the most important aspect is adhyatma, which means we have that freedom psychological that whatever happens to us, we are free to worry or not, to get disturbed by that or not’, and that freedom is the spiritual force within us. We all have that. It is our nature – called swabhava. A situation may be bad, but how to take that situation is in my hands. To get disturbed by the situation or not to get disturbed by it and to use it in the right way is a wonderful force of freedom. It is in our hands. The lady shouts, but the smile at her is the freedom that Buddha exercises. That is the spiritual knowledge within us. Once you have that in your hand, show me what can disturb you? There is nothing in this world that can disturb you. If somebody hurts you, equipped with this knowledge you can smile at him. If somebody slaps you on the cheek; you can turn the other cheek. We all have that freedom. If you apply this freedom even one per cent, you have a one per cent saint in you. You have become a Buddha; you have become a Christ for that moment, and this is our freedom. This is Karma Yoga. If we do good and don’t do anything bad even then we may have the problem of agony. It is because we do good and we now expect the results. If the good does not pay the results expected, it becomes our agony. This is the next subject noticed by the student. Let me tell another real life incident. You know Madras in India. There was a slum area. In these slums most often people do not keep their houses clean. A group of youngsters, who were really charged for doing something good, wanted to do good in that area. They went there and saw that the streets and the people were dirty. There was a lot of work to do. So they wanted to do selfless work. They cleaned the streets and the houses, and showed the people how to clean the dirt why to keep clean and live a life of hygiene. They collected all the garbage, threw it out, and gave baths to the kids. In the end, the kids were looking neat; the streets were neat. The time from morning to evening was spent usefully and they were happy. “See we did good work,” they said. They had peace of mind.</span><br/><span>The same group of youngsters came again to the same place the next week, and they found the place is as it was before and back in dirt. Yet they consoled themselves, saying “People will not learn it in one day. Maybe if we do this, another two-three weeks, people will slowly learn.” So the following Wednesday, they did the whole thing once again. They cleaned the whole place, disposed of the garbage, gave baths to the kids. Everyone was wonderful and happy. The next week they went there one more time and found the place no different. But they were still not tired. The same enthusiasm was there. They cleaned the whole place, did everything nice. People were happy; the students were happy. Then they went back. Then for the following Wednesday there were some important problems in some other part of the city. Since the students had to go there they could not come to the first place for one or two weeks,. They did all that - Happy. Then once again, the following Wednesday after that, they went back to the same slum area. As soon as the local people in that slum area saw the youngsters, they asked them, with anger,” What happened to you last week? Why did you not come to clean?”</span><br/><span>Now you are frustrated. You say to yourself, “I taught them something good. I tried to do good, but the good did not pay the result. The results are not coming forth. The people do not realize” This frustrates us. The work has not frustrated, but not getting the result of the work frustrated us. What we then normally do is blame the work and say that we should not do this work since the work causes us frustration. Look at this subtly. Work itself did not frustrate you, because the first week we enjoyed it; the second week we enjoyed it, and now it has become frustration! If work caused the frustration, had it not have always frustrated you? However, it gave happiness before and how can it give frustration now! If the work is causing frustration then how could it give satisfaction before and why not now?</span><br/><span>Work itself does not cause frustration, but there is something else that causes frustration; that is the expectation of the results. The expectation of the results gives us frustration. We do the work with a good attitude, but the expectation of the results is the bad attitude. That is why Krishna gives us a golden rule: Give up the fruit of the work. ‘Ma phaleshu kadaacana’. Give up the desire for the results. Immediately we have a rebel within us for that very thought. The question rises if we do not expect any results, then why do we do or why do we have to do the work? Here, we need to understand the nature of work from a deeper perspective.</span><br/><span>When you closely watch we see that we have good intention for doing good. If it is not there then you are not even fit for spiritual knowledge. Spirituality does not start if you have not arisen from bad to good! And a simple moral education is sufficient to make one to come towards doing good to others from doing bad. Therefore in the first place a spiritual person tends to do good to others. He plans and starts working towards that. From the time he starts doing he enjoys the activity. Doing bad has vengeance or venom behind it and that it is crippling and causing pain. He has come out of all that negativity the moment he comes out of doing bad. You were happy as you are doing the good work. That means your inner self was happy by doing good. But as we progress we start expecting results. The expectation of results is outside. Joy of doing the work is internal and very satisfying. But the moment your focus is outside you are disturbed. As long as your focus is inside, you are happy. The moment you turn your focus outside, you are unhappy. Therefore, expecting results brings you out of your personality. You start becoming anxious and frustration for seeing the results and disappointments if they do not give expected results. Even then the objection sustains. You say, “I did good work and the good work should give a good result”. You start wondering why there has been failure. You loose your faith in good work also. It appears good work may not have desired fruits.</span><br/><span>GOOD ACTION HAS GOOD RESULTSPlease understand there is nothing wrong with good work and good work has the result. You may not be able to see. Yes, the work has the result. You do not have the result. The result does not belong to you. The result belongs to the work itself. The fruits belong to the root. What the seed is, so is the fruit. The fruit belongs to the seed, and not to you.</span><br/><span>Be assured that every good work has a good fruit. However, it might not show the results today. Do you not see that good has a good flow of activity? People did good activity not because they wanted to see the good result. In fact, for doing good activity, many people meet with such horrible obstacles. A person who did good work has been given poison and another is crucified. Yet if the activity is good, it is going to bear good fruits one day. Socrates was given poison for the good message he spread. Jesus Christ was crucified for the compassion he spread. If we consider the activity and if he was interested in seeing the result, Jesus Christ was a failure, but look what happened after two thousand years? People follow Christ. Have that conviction. Any good work that you do is not a waste. It may have fruit some time, yet you may not be there to see it. You should not worry inside about seeing the fruits. Your efforts should be for the good.</span><br/><span>Krishna gave Gita for Arjuna in the battlefield five thousand years ago. Even then Arjuna was not satisfied and not totally reformed by that. If Krishna would have cared only for Arjuna, he would have been a miserable person after giving the whole of Gita to Arjuna. He would have been depressed. “Such a wonderful message I have given. Nobody has benefited by that.” Krishna never looked at the benefit. He wanted to give a good message, and that is why this same message is vibrantly living after five thousand years.</span><br/><span>In America, I was working with psychiatric patients. One very wealthy billionaire lawyer lady came to me for psychological support. I told her some ideas with which she was very happy. Then I told her that this idea is from a text called Gita. Her face brightened. “How wonderful this text is! How wonderful this idea is,” she exclaimed. She was really blissful, but then she became depressed and asked me, “You say that this idea is from Gita, and Gita is a Hindu text whereas I am a Christian. How can I apply this?” I said, “Krishna did not have the idea for one particular race or for one particular person. His message is for the mankind. If it is useful, take it. If it helps you take out of your problem, please use it.” She was so grateful for that thought. She realized it is not to convert one from one faith to the other but it to help mankind from his/ her misery</span><br/><span>Our good is not dependent on a person, a race, or on an area. Our good is for the mankind. Good has no boundaries. The moment good work is attached with an agenda wanting someone to get converted then the good work lost its importance to conversion and that is no more a good work. Goodness of good work becomes secondary and our other agenda becomes primary. A good work does not have any boundaries. Only with the expectation of results, we create boundaries. When Krishna said ‘don’t think of the results’, he never meant that good results were not going to come. His idea was ‘don’t create a boundary around goodness’. The thing which has no boundary is called as the divine (Ananthata= infinite). This is Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga tells us to do the good activity and not to look at the results.</span><br/><span>EGO OF GOOD WORK IS BADBut there is one more step Krishna wants us to recognize and it will take us one more step ahead.</span><br/><span>Despite the fact that there is no visible result that you expected, do not become depressed. The assurance is that the result is going to be there anyway. Then the second objection when we start thinking is: “What a wonderful, good work I’m doing. I am not even expecting results, but I am doing good work.” This doing good work can become our ego. This is the evil about the good work. A person who does bad work is saved from this evil anyway. A person who does bad work is not egoistic, but a person who does good work can become egoistic. We have to be careful with that. Who are you to do good work? You can never do good work. Good work is always there in this world. You can only become a part of the good work that has been going on. I tell the truth. Truth is always there. Millions of people have been telling truth, and the truth is supporting them. The same way, you are also telling the truth. You can be egoistic of goodness if you start thinking you are doing good work. Subtly seeing you can only join the good forces that are there in this world. Even before the untruth took birth, truth was there. So truth is something which is eternal. The good work is eternal. It is like a river that flows all the time, perennial. Your good work is like taking a dip in that river. Be humble. Be humble that you are given a chance to be good. Good is going on, and you are associated with that. Thank God that you have become part of the good force that is going on. This attitude takes away the ego of goodness, which is much more dangerous.</span><br/><span>There is another important aspect of Karma Yoga. Whether good or bad, I will do the work. I can think good. I can plan good. I can organize good. I do so many wonderful things. This has to be eliminated. Consider the simple fact that I am giving this message. I could be egoistic. But many people have already said what Krishna also said all that knowledge has come to me consciously and unconsciously and from me to you. You are fortunate that you have intelligence. You are fortunate that you are able to put these things together. How can you therefore be egoistic about it and claim the ownership of the knowledge?</span><br/><span>Three gunasThere are several external agencies responsible in all these activities and it is you are fortunate so you are able to give. For example, if you had mental retardation, what would you have done? Or if people had not passed on this information to you, will you have created it? Therefore, do an activity but do not be the doer behind it. Do not give up doing the activity just because you are not a doer. This is the essence of Karma Yoga.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another aspect of Karma Yoga. Karma means activity. God has created a variety of activities. They are absolutely unique, marvelous, and different. That is how the whole universe is created. Observe nature carefully. You will understand. Look at a plant. We have never looked at a plant leisurely. If you look patiently at a plant you can see the wonderful work going on there. The roots go to the ground, and we really do not know what and how they collect from the earth and ground. They untiringly work inside, absolutely in the darkness of the earth, and do not keep what they collect for themselves; they relentlessly pass it on. There is also a stem, the plant portion. It holds the plant tight, has a hard outer cover to protect the plant from external attacks from the creatures outside, and passes on this wonderful message up the plant. Then on the top, you can see the wonderful leaves, foliage, and the flowers shining in the sky. We look at the leaves, the foliage and flowers, and see how beautiful the tree is, and how wonderful it looks; and we see that as a tree. However, leaves are there for a few months until the fall comes, when we see all are gone. It looks as if the tree is dead, but when the tree is dead, when the whole leaves are gone, all that you see is the dry branches sticking out dead like, yet it is still the roots that hold the life. The roots have all the patience. They patiently wait for the next sun to come. They patiently wait for the next spring to come. They give total assurance to the plant: do not worry. You will once again carry that beauty and give fresh leaves and flowers. Those roots do such a wonderful sacrifice. Thus, each part is doing its own job in this plant.</span><br/><span>The plant is divided into three different aspects for the sake of our convenience; the roots, the stem and the flowers and foliage. In a plant all these things are necessary for its existence. The manifestation might have taken place separately but the intelligence of roots; stem and foliage are always available. For the sake of understanding they are given the identity as sattva, rajas and tamas. The flowers and foliage are called as sattva; the trunk is called as rajas; and, the roots under the ground are called as tamas. These three divisions namely sattva, rajas and tamas can be found in the whole creation. You can find the same description in the whole of manifested world. Just look at a human being. He has feet always on the ground, and carrying the weight of the whole body and help you climb up and down the stairs. The feet never complain that you have so much weight although they themselves are on the ground all the time. What the feet do is a selfless work. That is the tamas aspect of us.</span><br/><span>The middle portion of the body, which holds the body together, and which distributes the food everywhere and cleans the blood all the time, is called the rajas. Then we have the head where you see, think, enjoy, plan, scheme, and imagine: a totally different kind of activity. This is called the sattva. So in our body we also have rajas, tamas, and sattva. </span><br/><span>The leaves, the flowers, the fruits, the sky, and the fresh air, are all sattva. The stem the braches are all rajas. So also any thing hard and working all the time holding together like the way a trunk holds the tree together protects all are rajas and the roots buried all the time under the cover if the soil which does not see the light of the day and the putrefied, decomposed food which is the food of the roots darkness where the roots are always are all tamas. Darkness also means not having knowledge not seeing the brightness of life all are tamas. Tamas also means therefore darkness. Similarly there are these activities which are called the sattva, rajas, and tamas. Soft, gentle, quiet activities are sattvic. The activity of the nature of constantly supplying and distributing the material from the roots to the whole of plant and holding the plant together and protecting all are rajasic activity. There is also another activity which is tirelessly going on doing monotonous work not seeing the light of the day, hard, constantly pressurized labor kind of activity, which is tamas. Thus, the creation is made out of all these three different kinds. This is how the whole creation can be looked at it is made up of these three gunas namely sattva, rajas, and tamas. Krishna says, “Look at all these three things.” This is how basically nature and activity can be explained into three different kinds.</span><br/><span>Unfortunately most of the spiritual texts set sattva, rajas, and tamas into a hierarchy, saying that sattva is very good and wonderful, and that we all should go to sattva, whereas rajas is bad, and tamas is horrible. This is how most of the texts have translated, but it appears to me in a different way. Each is important and each is doing its own work wonderfully. If you say sattva is good, being in the fresh air, and the flowers and foliage are good, and you take the roots and keep it in the sky trying to make it sattva, the plant will die. Similarly, if you say, “Why do my feet have to carry the body all the time? Let the feet also be in the space outside. Let me use my feet in thinking because I would like my feet to do sattvic activity. Therefore, I will stand on my head.” That’s not right. Each has to do its own job. Sattva has to happen in a sattvic way. Rajas has to work in a rajasic way. Tamas has to work in a tamasic way. Not only that, only when sattva is recognized and provided the chance to manifest its natural state of sattva it is going to be in bliss, and same way rajas is recognized as rajas and provided the opportunity to manifest rajas naturally it will be pleased, and tamas needs the same way recognition.</span><br/><span>In the human beings also there are three categories of people. It is not that a person who is of one quality does not manifest other qualities but basically one or the other qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas will be predominant and others will be supporting that major quality. We may have all these three, but one of these qualities can be dominant in us. Some people have sattva as predominant quality. These are people engaged in thinking, planning, and scheming which are basically sattvic activities. Whereas people who are rajas by nature can protect and organize an army of people for giving protection or for running an organization or a country due to their very nature. They are also people who can distribute things and do trade just like the way the middle portion of our body does. These are people who belong to the category of kings and traders. It is their very nature to be able to do that. Sattvic people are like our head by nature. They think and organize. Rajasic people are like our trunk or stomach portion which protects and organizes the food etc. There is also a fourth category of people who are like our feet. They can do heavy work. They do the labor work and we should be able to appreciate their activity. They are like our feel which carries the weight of the body without any complaint from morning to night. We can not say that tamasic activities are inferior activities and thinking and planning are superior activities. We are here to improve the world and make them go from tamas to rajas and then ultimately to sattva. That is the way we can improve the mankind. Therefore in order to improve a person we should make one to do sattvic activity and take him out of tamas activities. By making them to do these activities they are not suitable for such sattvic activity, actually you are giving them trouble. A scientist is a sattvic person. But if a scientist says, “All right, let me start a business,” he will be a failure. Business requires a different frame of mind. It is a rajasic mind. A professor is a sattvic person. If you put him in the army, he will be a failure. He can only think in a way of a scientist. The other day I heard an incident.</span><br/><span>During a state of emergency in a country they wanted to have many people in army and they were recruiting all eligible adults were being recruited in army. A professor was drafted into the army and during the training period the captain was giving orders. They were learning to march and the captain was ordering, “Left right, left right. Right turn. Left turn… And left turn. And another right turn’. The professor stood. He did not move with the others. The captain came to him and asked, “Why don’t you join the march?” The professor asked the captain, “You first decide which way to go. Then I will move. You are constantly changing, right turn, left turn and all that.” The professor cannot understand that. By nature, he is a different person.</span><br/><span>Similarly, there is a fourth category of people who are laborers, and we have to have respect for them. What they do is a wonderful job. If you ask a professor to do the labor job, he will be a failure, whereas certain people are there for work like that. Understanding their nature, putting them to the kind of work that they are suited to would be a wonderfully harmonious match. The work which is harmonious for you, and the activity which harmoniously blends with your nature does not become a burden.</span><br/><span>I was having a colleague in my office. He is a trained engineer but he is basically tamasic in nature. He was happy doing preparing the reports work which really does not require any brain but it is simply collecting the data from one report and reorganizing into another report. He was never tired doing such repetitive activity without any complaint. He does not worry why is he doing that work where that report is going to go or is there any other way of simplifying the repetitive monotonous work. Many of us were wondering how can he do it that we could not have done for such long time. It is alright for few days doing such repetitive work. Therefore these divisions namely the learned class, royal class, trader class, and the labor class are basically divided because of their innate quality of sattva, rajas, and tamas and generally speaking they come by birth in the family.</span><br/><span>Gandhi was a businessman by birth. The business spirit or the money matter was there in his blood from hereditary. To show how subtle this nature was, let me give an example that I heard some where from his life.</span><br/><span>Those days when freedom struggle was going on, he inspired the whole country by his talks. One day in Ahmadabad, he was giving a talk. There were thousands of people who assembled. It was in the night. First he inspired them for the national freedom struggle and then said that this required a lot of funds. He wanted to raise funds. People were really charged to participate in freedom struggle by giving donations. The organizers spread a white sheet on the stage. People came in a cue, and they were giving whatever money, jewelry they had, throwing it onto the white sheet. All the leaders were standing there. After all was collected, the leaders made a list of the things given. Gandhi was talking to somebody. They finished the counting and showed the list to him. Gandhi looked at the list, just glanced, and then asked them, “Have you taken everything?” They said, “Yes.” He asked again, “Did you not miss any small little thing?” They said, “No. Why don’t you check again?” thus he insisted. They started feeling a little annoyed. Because, you know, businessmen look into small things when the question of money is there. They do not even want to leave small things. He has become a national leader but he still has the quality of a businessman. They were a bit irritated. Realizing this, Gandhi said, “OK. Let’s go now.” Then they retired into the tent.</span><br/><span>Suddenly in the middle of the night, Gandhi came unto the stage with a small little lantern. When he was coming, the others also followed him. When he came unto the stage, he found a small stool standing in the corner. One little earring was lying underneath it. He picked up the earring and gave it to the man. “Please take this also carefully because I respect this. Whoever has given this thing must have really urged, pleaded God, that with this, the country should get freedom. That’s why this is very precious,” he said. Then they asked Gandhi, “We have really mistaken you, Gandhiji. How could you guess it and how did you know something must have gone there?” He said, “Naturally, people were coming from this direction, and when they threw their donation items, something could roll and fall in that direction. So I thought that we had not checked under the small table. That’s why I’ve come.” Then they asked him, “How did you know that something was missing?” This is a very businessman like attitude that comes into the picture. “When I was glancing at the list, I have seen the necklace and this and that. They were all alright but when I looked at the number of earrings, I thought that anybody would give two earrings, not one earring. So I should finally have an even number, not an odd number. When I looked at the number of earrings, it was an odd number. Then I thought something must be missing.”</span><br/><span>This is the attitude of a businessman. A businessman cannot miss this. Similarly some people by their very nature are leaders and protective. So Karma Yoga says ‘recognize one’s inner nature and give the right kind of work’. Do the work the way that it needs to be done, and then the work will not be a burden.</span><br/><span>Nature itself is not a bad it is a combination of sattva, rajas or tamas in a harmonious proportions. Neither sattva is bad, or rajas or tamas. They are what they are. In the journey of life we come across all these things namely sattva, rajas, and tamas. We are comfortable with what suits our nature and there is nothing right or wrong about it. Even the colors can be looked from the angle of sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Even the colors also have an appeal according to ones nature. That is why we like also colors accordingly and nothing wrong in that. One might wonder, how can somebody like those colors. It is only that their nature makes them to appreciate those colors!</span><br/><span>If every thing is fine, what is wrong and why suffering? Our suffering is due to our attachments. Our problem is our attachment with one or the other. If my nature is sattva I tend to do and choose things according to my nature called sattva and if my nature is rajas I do things and I like things which are rajasic in nature. This is perfect. But life does not always go on in one guna. Here and there once in a while we may have to shift from one guna to other guna according to the necessity. If I am attached to sattva, even when I have to do rajas or tamas, I still end up doing sattva way only due to my attachment. It is like an obsession in the body. A crude example can be if there is some problem in the body the sattvic way to manage is to just apply a balm, and the rajasic way is to give some harsh and painful drugs or application and tmasic way is to cut and do surgery. In case of a growth in the body where you really need a surgery if the surgeon says he is sattvic, he does everything in a sattva way only, even when he needs to cut open the body, take out the abscess, and take out the growth… it is an obsession and is not in harmony. This is wrong! </span><br/><br/><span>B</span><br/><br/><span>When I need to beat, I need to beat. When I can do it in a soft and gentle way, I should do that way. We should have this freedom. And this freedom is possible only if you do not have an attachment to any one of these natures.</span><br/><span>Sattva is good at some places and bad at some places but attachment to sattva is always bad. Rajas is also good on some situations and bad in some situations where as attachment to rajas is always bad. Tamas is also good in some situations and bad in other situations but attachment to tamas is always bad. Thus, yoga is non-attachment: non-attachment to all three gunas.</span><br/><span>Karma, akarma,</span><br/><span>vikarmaIf you have an attachment, you do it your own way. The result may be some times success and many times may be failure. But you still continue to do it your own way because of your attachment. Though from the point of view of the result of the activity, it may be successful but from the point of view of self it is always bad and non- spiritual because such an activity promotes our attachment only. Therefore what you do is not depended on what is the result but what is the state of the subject or self. If the subject is getting more and ore bound by his nature he is getting bound, if the person is not getting caught up in his own nature then it is freedom. If our focus is on outside it is worldliness and if the attention is self then it is spirituality. Whereas if you do not have an attachment, you can do what is right. One more concept of Karma Yoga and then we can stop.</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna gives one more idea of karma yoga in Gita:</span><br/><span>Different people have different explanations about the concept of karma, akarma, and vikarma about which Krishna says in Gita. It is often stated that karma is the rituals and the activities such as the performances of Yagana etc. and akarma is like the non action and the example they give is the axle which is behind the wheel. Finally vikarma is explained as the actions which are prohibited like violence, steeling and robbing, injuring some thing telling lies and series of activities of this nature which are essentially bad. I had difficulty in understanding this because Krishna need not say these things to Arjuna because Arjuna has already been good. he can not think of doing any thing of this sort. There is no reason Krishna has to tell him what is good activity and what is the bad activity and also advice him not to do bad activity and do only good activity. We don’t need spiritual knowledge to tell us to do good actions and not to do bad, to do right and not to do wrong. This is the roll of simple moral knowledge. It is not spiritual knowledge because spiritual knowledge is far beyond the moral knowledge. Arjuna has been highly moral and yet he is suffering. Therefore moral knowledge can not find a solution which he needed. Therefore in my point of view we need to look at it from a different angle at Vikarma different from moral angle so that we can get spiritual knowledge. Let me share with you this idea.</span><br/><span>According to Krishna in Gita, he says there are three things which he states as karma akarma and vikarma. These can be translated as action, non-action and reaction. It is easy to understand action and non-action but it is difficult to relate it with reaction.</span><br/><span>Action is fine, non-action is fine. He calls action as karma. When he says A+KARMA we can look at it as non+action. He says karma is fine, and that akarma is also fine. However he says, don’t do Vikarma. Now in this statement he brings the third concept called as Vikarma. It is unique with Gita. Vikarma is bad. Krishna says, that activity is OK, non-activity is also fine, but he also says, don’t do Vikarma.</span><br/><span>Vikarma puzzles us. We wonder what is it and how does it exist. When there is some thing to be done, you either do it or do not do it. You only have two alternatives. Here is a simple example. I am watching a football game. My wife is busy in the kitchen. And the child cries. Maybe he needs a diaper change. He cries. I tell my wife, “Take care of the kid.” She responds, “You take care of the kid as I am busy in the kitchen cooking!” I say “I am also busy and it is the duty of the mother and not the father to take care of the child”, I bring in law point. I now have two alternatives: I either do karma or akarma. I take care of child or I do not take care of him. I choose not to take care of him because I have an idea. It is not a man who should take care of the child. So I tell my wife, “I am busy here watching the football match. You take care of the kid.” I know in my heart also that it is only an excuse and I am not busy. I don’t have to see football match, after all what is there if I don’t watch football match!</span><br/><span>She says, “All right, I’ll take care of the kid, but you will not have lunch.” That is her triumph card. That is a problem for me now. Now what to do? I now feel no other alternative as I don’t want to miss the lunch!! Then very unwillingly I agree to take care of the kid with out one more word of argument, but deep inside, I feel angry. Why should I take care? I should not be doing this. I am a man. Men should not take care of children. Men only give birth for a child. All such arguments rise inside. Yet I still go and take care of him. I now angrily ask the child, “Yes, tell me what are you doing all this mess for”? Wife hears my harsh voice and says from in side the kitchen talk to him nicely, don’t be unkind. Now I can’t even be harsh so I stomach my anger and work! That way while I am doing an activity my inside is constantly telling me “don’t do”. This doing has a strong fight inside. This is defined as vikarma. Vikarma is essentially keeping the negativity and fighting inside while doing an activity. This fighting is roughly called as ‘reaction’. Krishna says that action is fine. Non-action is also fine, but this reaction is bad because the reaction disturbs your inner peace and harmony. Reaction is a poison in our body. Every reaction throws adrenalin in the body in an erratic way. Every reaction disturbs your body chemistry. Reaction is bad. Our action can be reaction. Even our non-action can be reaction. So reaction can manifest in the form of action as well as non-action. What we see outside is action or non-action but what is hidden behind is reaction. Action or non-action is only outer cover, but the spirit behind is reaction. Looking or caring for action or non-action is looking at the world but looking and caring for the reaction or the spirit behind is the spirituality.</span><br/><span>Now look at our twenty-four hours of the day and seven days of the week. How much time are you spending doing action, or non-action? And how much you are spending our time and energy in reaction?</span><br/><span>Suppose you have to get up early in the morning. No doubt you get up early morning as alarm rings and realize what the first thought that comes into your mind is: “Oh my God, I have to get up. I don’t want to get up. It is horrible. I shouldn’t go to that office.” But then you get up and go. You are on the road. You say to your self, “Horrible traffic! Everybody is on the road!” But you still travel. You reach office and there you find your boss and momentarily you say to yourself, “See, how horrible it is. Now I have to face him throughout the day”. Yet you smile and greet. Understand that in each of these actions every one of them is nothing but reaction only.</span><br/><span>Same way your non action is in true sense not non-action. You are resting. But you are not peacefully resting. Thought comes up, “if I don’t sleep, what will happen tomorrow? Should I get up and do this and this or should I just say let me do it tomorrow”. That sleep also has an agenda. Ninety per cent of our whole day is in the form of reactions. That is why we are in trouble. Krishna says, “Give up reaction.” Once you give up reaction then you will not have the problem of this fight within and the disharmony within. We feel that is alright but if I do not react how the other person can be set right? I have to get anger; I have to have my reaction and I can not give up reaction.</span><br/><span>Reaction causes disturbances in our body chemistry, it spoils the interpersonal relationship. Reaction creates negativity. Reaction is bad. Though it is bad if I don’t have reaction what do I do?</span><br/><span>The opposite of reaction is not ‘non-doing’ because reaction can manifest both in the form of doing and non-doing. Do not have reaction. Opposite to reaction is response! Your response helps the situation to become alright. Reaction many times may help the situation temporarily but on a long run it can hurt the situation also. Response unites where as reaction separates! Have response. Respond to the situation. Your response is what is important. Response has compassion and love, where as reaction is very mechanical, it does not have soul! Response is healthy where as reaction is not healthy to one self or even for the situation.</span><br/><span>Reaction has the tone i have a right to do this way or the other way. Reaction is basically based on our rights. I have a right to react. It is showing our right. The question choosing between reaction and response is actually between rights and responsibilities. These days, people talk so much about their rights that it is the most important thing in life. Individual rights constitutional rights, human rights children rights abuse of rights so on and so forth. From morning to evening we keep hearing about the rights.</span><br/><span>I was trying to find out what to call for rights in the Sanskrit based languages. Very surprisingly I found that there is no word equivalent in Sanskrit language for right, there is no word for right! Sanskrit language is one of the richest languages. It has so many words, which are not there in other languages. When Sanskrit could give us many words could they not have been given one more word called “right”? They wontedly carefully avoided the concept.</span><br/><span>They have not given a word for “right”. That is why none of the Indian languages born from Sanskrit has a word for “right”. In all Indian languages, we only use the word “haq” to express right, but “haq” does not have a Sanskrit origin. “Haq” has an Arabic origin. It must have been borrowed after the Muslim invasion of India which is as recent as 12th century or 13th century. But why did we borrow this word? Simple answer is we did not have a word called right. How could a culture survive for ten thousand years without a word called right! Or is it that because we did not have that word, the whole culture survived for a ten thousand years without a “right”. Please understand that this is very important issue. The culture survived not only without “haq”, but the culture survived because that there was no “haq”. Is it not that this haq is a great poison for the social harmony. Search for the whole Indian literature you will find references for responsibilities and nowhere there is reference for rights!</span><br/><span>We have no rights but we have responsibilities under Indian culture. During the whole period of Sanskrit literature for ten thousand years, nobody has a right. This we can not even imagine! The king has no rights. Subjects do not have any rights. Women have no rights, men have no rights. Parents have no rights. Children have no rights. But everybody has responsibilities. The king has a responsibility. The subject has a responsibility. The parents have responsibilities. Children have responsibilities. Why?</span><br/><span>A ‘rights’ divide you. If the parents say, “These are my rights” to the children, they are not one unit bout they are separating themselves out. The husband says, “These are my rights” to his wife, they don’t become a unit together but he is separating out. If a king says, “I have rights,” he is not one of the people. Whereas, on the other hand, if he says he has the responsibility he is part of the whole population. Like the way hands and legs are part of the body and try to survive and be happy collectively. Same way according to Indian philosophy a home or a town or a s kingdom all are living organisms like out body and various persons involved in this are various components sharing the responsibility of collective living. Father is not is not separate from the family. An individual is not separate from the society king is not separate from the kingdom. Rights separate and responsibilities unite. Everybody’s responsibility is to unite with the other. The parents have the responsibility to make the house beautiful. The children have the responsibility to make house beautiful. The king has the responsibility to make the country beautiful. The subjects have a responsibility to make the country beautiful. Responsibilities bring people together. Rights separate. Responsibility has yoga, reunion built in it. Rights separate us. That is why a culture which has responsibility as the root, is a culture which survives, which is time tested. A simple example: there are thirteen of us here. If we take responsibilities, it becomes simple. On the other hand if we sit and say, “This is my right, and this is my right,” we can only destroy.</span><br/><span>I only wish if these concepts of Karma Yoga spread in the world we may want this strong message that we should have a world society where everybody is responsible. What a wonderful world we can create. We have the responsibility to see the world will be with richness. Trees are rich, rivers are rich, forests are rich and every where there is richness. How can I do that? It is simple. Before I destroy any thing let me construct double of that. Before I take a leaf from a plant, let me give water to the plant so that it has two leaves.</span><br/><span>Responsibility comes from within. Responsibility has a satisfaction in itself where as rights are looking for the satisfaction elsewhere. A right has to be imposed from outside. A right requires constitution. Responsibility requires spirituality. We have this wonderful country India, for ten thousand years its culture was based on responsibility. This has been said all over the scriptures, and when we got freedom, our leaders wanted to write a constitution. They were very good and patriotic but they lacked the necessary spiritual attitude to look at the spiritual basis of this culture which survived this for ten thousand years intact if not more. The country was not only survived but was the most prosperous. Until few centuries ago the whole world was looking up to India for riches and happiness. Alexander the great came to conquer this country if it were not rich. Gory Muhammad and Ghajni Muhammad would not have invaded this country umpteen number of times and plundered its wealth if it were not prosperous. Vasco De Gamma or Columbus would not have dreamt of reaching India if India were not prosperous! Our leaders would have thought what made this country prosperous? What was the unique feature which was there in its thought process instead of totally rejecting India means a bundle of out dated dogmas! The framers of constitution have taken guidance from American constitution, French constitution and British constitution to frame ours. There fore our constitution has looked at the rights of every one and not the responsibilities. Our culture was based on responsibilities and our constitution is based on rights. Therefore unfortunately, what happened is that our constitution and ruling is mismatched with the culture. It is one of my dreams that the day comes and hope that is not far away, that we recreate a society based on responsibility, and show the world that something like that can work.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Naishkarmya Siddhi,</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita brings about another extraordinary subtler aspect of activity, which is about naishkarma that state is called as naishkarmya. This is different from Nishkama-Karma, action without desire for fruit. A simple meaning of the word sounds that it is “non-doing”. It sounds very much like non action, but it is different and it is very spiritual.</span><br/><br/><span>He says ‘just by non-action one does not reach the state of non-doing, just as by rejecting the world one does not reach the fullness of satisfaction or one attains the supreme’. He shows a clear difference between non-action and the state of non doing. Action and non-action are two different things as discussed earlier. Let me try to explain them in detail. Action and no action are opposite to one another. Both options are there for us very clearly in all activities. We do an activity or we don’t do an activity, either we take the stance of doing or we can take the stance of non-doing depending upon the need and the situation we are in.</span><br/><span>I put the seed in a prepared bed of soil and give all necessary things like manure, water, and sunshine etc. Now the plant has to go on its journey from out of seed. That is not in our hands. I now sit and wait. Until now I was on the phase of action now I am in the phase of non- action. I can be agitated and restless; I may pace up and down. These are the only kind of activities I can do. About the plant coming out of the seed I have to wait and see but nothing I can do. I have to accept non-action. I cannot pluck the plant out of seed. Nothing I can do about it. I cannot even say, let me reduce the suffering of the plant in coming out of seed by plucking it out of seed. I may on the other hand, damage the plant or kill the plant itself.</span><br/><span>I read the story long time ago whose significance I see now in this context. Some where a social worker saw, a butterfly struggling to come out of its pupa, it is still very tiny and cute but it is going to be a big butterfly when it comes out, but now it is struggling in the pupa to come out. He felt compassionate towards the little one. He felt bad when he saw that the butter-fly is struggling with the hard shell of pupa to break. Now this social worker wanted to help; he thought after all, let me cut the pupa wall little by little without injuring the butter fly, so that he could release a butterfly out of the hard shell.</span><br/><br/><span>His intention was not even bad; it was on other hand very good. His intension was never to hurt the butterfly. His intension was not even to see the butterfly fast and own the butterfly. Don’t find fault with his intentions in any way. When he fully cut open the pupa wall the butterfly is released. Freshly coming out to the world, the butter fly fluttered her wings to dry and make it loose, and she wanted to fly in the open sky.</span><br/><br/><span>Other butterflies also come out of their shelter, come out of their pupa but naturally with out cutting their pupa and they also fluttered their wings free, and in front of his eyes they started flying in the infinite sky and into fresh air. But this butterfly, which he helped, wanted to fly but could not. The person now found out that the butterfly wings are not fully grown. Like the wings of the other butterflies who struggle their way through and who come out of pupa in natural process. The social worker lamented. ‘Oh, god! What happened’? He wanted to help the butterfly he felt the butterfly is struggling its way but unfortunately, if the butterfly gone through the struggle she would have had fully grown strong wings, but because he did not provide the opportunity to the wings , the opportunity to the butterfly to struggle her way she didn’t develop her wings fully.</span><br/><br/><span>Intensions may be good. But a lack of patience wanting to be doer can create a problem.</span><br/><br/><span>He has done something which has caused the suffering and he became the doer because he thought he can reduce the suffering of the butterfly. How can you reduce the suffering of plant coming out of a seed, or the suffering of a butterfly coming out of a pupa?</span><br/><br/><span>Don’t be a player, even in good activity. Some people become players by involving in doing an activity. On the other hand some other people would become players by withdrawing from doing an activity. So in doing an activity or in not doing an activity, in both cases one can become a player and in turn the sufferer.</span><br/><br/><span>Allow ‘doing’ to happen, allow ‘non-doing’ to happen, in both the cases don’t be a player. Human being has a wonderful facility over other creature. Matter has the consciousness which has totally become existence. Matter has nothing but existence. Plants and animals have consciousness, which becomes existence and also the conscious of existence. That’s why plants and animals not only exist but they can work towards existence. Plants send roots in to the ground, through the stones and pebbles to reach the water bed and to get the nutrients. Plants send the leaves in the direction of the sun to support its existence through the process of photosynthesis. The same way animals search their foods. And struggle for existence, because they are conscious of existence.</span><br/><br/><span>Whereas the human being is existence and conscious of existence and in addition to the both, he is conscious of the consciousness for existence.</span><br/><br/><span>That is why he can be a witness of his existence. And he can also be the conscious of his means or effort for existence. But he has an option in this. He can become a totally involved doer, struggling for existence and may be totally absent as an observer or witness. But he can also be totally a person conscious of the effort of existence which is witness. He can identify himself with the one who is struggling and putting effort for existence. And he can also be witness of the one, who is struggling or putting effort for existence. The moment one become witness, one is free form ups and downs, successes and failures and all emotional upsurges behind the player. Then he can witness that the play is going on. Then the doing is happening. This is the state called naishkarmaya, the non doer. Such a person who has realized naishkarma, or who achieved naishkarmya siddhi, he is walking yet not walking; he is talking, yet not talking etc., ‘I am doing’, concept of him is totally dissolved and he is totally one with the witness and which is nothing but ‘I am being’. </span><br/><br/><span>Once you become a sakshi or witness, the search for happiness through the objective possessions, recognitions and all the other things from outside do not make any sense. One finds the happiness within. Search for the happiness outside may be one type of bondage, which is crossed. Subtler than this bondage is the bondage of wanting to be the doer. The doer bondage is much more disturbing and is very difficult to recognize. All the people who do and want to do good are seldom caught in this bondage. That is the reason you see their life becomes very serious and the bliss of life will only be at the lips level. He is constantly in pairs of opposite and he can not accept both success and failure are one and the same. Once this bondage is dropped, he is then free. One who reaches his freedom he is beyond the ultimate pairs of opposite called the birth and death.</span><br/><br/><span>Between birth and death, two aspects are blended. We are working and also we are living. One is the ‘doing aspect’, between the birth and death, heart will be pumping blood, breathing goes on, the nourishment as to take place and the struggle for the existence is continuing. All these things are one aspect of life which is the doing aspect. The doing has the limitation of birth and death. And the doing stops with the death. The stopping of the doing itself is death.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another aspect underlying this doing which is the ‘being’ aspect, the being has been going through all these changes. Yet the being has none of these limitations or the pairs of opposite. It is free. It has no boundaries.</span><br/><br/><span>One who is held by doing is bound by limitations. Therefore fear will be there; where as one, who is identified by being, he is the existence itself. Such a person will not be touch by birth and death success or failure, praise or blame, or finally birth and death. Fear will be there if we want one and we don’t want the other and there is a possibility to get the one which is not our choice. Therefore fear does not touch him who does not have pairs of opposite. That is called as final ‘abhaya’ state or the state of ‘freedom from fear’. This is the subtlest aspect of karma yoga called naishkarmya siddhi. Achieving this in karma yoga is parallel to achieving Samadhi in raja yoga. The description of Brahman is given us “Sat Chit Ananda” where Sat means the existence itself. A person who achieves naishkarmya siddhi has achieved the sat aspect of Brahman and becomes one with Brahman.</span><br/><span>Several ideas are there on Karma Yoga. Let me just give one final message. Yoga does not mean running away from the work. Yoga is holding responsibilities more joyfully and harmoniously. Yoga does not make somebody irresponsible. If it makes anybody irresponsible, it is not yoga.</span><br/><br/><span>Let me now sum up these few ideas of karma yoga:</span><br/><span>Karma yoga can be one of the paths of yoga if only it contributes to the peace of mind and harmony with-in like all other paths of yoga have to give us the peace of mind and harmony.</span><br/><span>‘Doing good actions and guiding us not to do bad actions’ is not purpose of karma yoga. This is at simple moral level. Good and bad is at ordinary level of human transaction. If a human being is not doing good and doing bad he is to be punished. There is no spirituality in this. Arjuna was already good but he needed Bhagavad-Gita. It means that karma yoga is not to give us the clarity about good and bad but to take us beyond.</span><br/><span>So the journey or the sadhana of karma yoga is to rise from good action to the action without expectations of fruits of action, and finally to go to action where the doer is absent and the doer ship is sacrificed and dissolved.</span><br/><span>This is similar to the last three steps in astanga yoga namely dharana dhyana Samadhi. These are sat karma, phalapeksha rahita karma and finally naishkarmya siddhi. Like the body is the temple of god the same way the work we do is also the worship of god. It is our ignorance which makes us to take work as stress or curse or punishment and only if we do some specific activity that will be karma yoga and sacred. An attitude which can make this transformation of all activities we do is karma yoga.</span><br/><span>Thank you so much.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Question: Could you please repeat the last sentence in Sanskrit?</span><br/><br/><span>I’ll tell you where Krishna thinks about this idea.</span><br/><br/><span>karmany evadhikaras te, ma phalesu kadacana</span><br/><span>ma karma-phala-hetur bhuh, ma te sango ’stv akarmani</span><br/><span>Oh, Arjuna you have the adhikara to do the action but not the fruits for the action. You also do not become the cause for the fruits and don’t be attached to non-action.</span><br/><br/><span>Regarding the origin of this knowledge of yoga, Krishna gives a very philosophical Arjuna. In Bhagavad-Gita Arjuna asks Krishna “Look, you are telling all these things. When did all this knowledge come?” Krishna answers that this knowledge is called as yoga and is ageless. Basically the principles of yoga are given birth to creation. Even when creation had not taken place, the concept of creation, the concept of yoga had always been a part of existence. This is a basic idea. The creation has originated from the concept of harmony. When he created the day, simultaneously the night was created. When the birth was created, at the same time the death was defined. This means that this concept of harmony, which is essentially yoga, was even there before creation has taken place. And at any point of time, if the survival has to continue, then this balance has to be maintained. So that is why this idea of yoga or the state of yoga is something which is always there through time. This is why it is called as ageless. This is something which is there at the background and this is the background for the rhythm that is there. A thing which does not belong to this gets eliminated.</span><br/><span>For example, when man did not have all this technological developments, all this culture and civilization, it was not that he was sitting in a forest meditating. He was living harmoniously. That is his support of life. It is this harmony which maintained him. That is the background of life. In fact, one of the Upanishads uses this statement called “yoga dandha”. It basically means that the central core support is yoga.</span><br/><span>As man has grown he required a method of practice which has to remind him about yoga all the time. That is how these practices evolved. Every one is engaged in these practices as a part of the culture whether he is a servant or a teacher or a trader every one used to practice yoga on a regular basis. The king who was ruling a kingdom of lavishness and luxury is also a student of yoga. Yoga is taught in the school to small children. Yoga is also taught to Arjuna by Krishna in the battlefield. In that sense, yoga is all inclusive. One might wonder what yoga Arjuna was to know in Battle field. Definitely it was not the practice of asanas. But it was definitely yoga. Therefore it is always chanted that it is Bhagavad-Gita and the science of yoga.</span><br/><span>People have taken yoga and tried to use it for their own smaller purposes. For example, the Indian dance has developed on the principles of yoga. Indian cooking has developed on the principles of yoga. People have picked few ideas of yoga although they lack the whole system of management.</span><br/><span>You are asking me a question about new age group and ask me is it yoga. There are a few yoga principles here and there they have picked up and that they started giving several names. One such thing is what is called a new age group. And they say, “What we are saying the same thing yoga also says.” Actually few of them grasped what yoga says. In my opinion, I have no objection about that since you pick up a few principles of yoga and make your life better. It is wonderful.</span><br/><br/><span>QUESTION: You are talking about good and bad, and it is critical in the end deciding what is good and what is bad because it is relative and good and bad changes according to culture. So how will we decide?</span><br/><br/><span>In fact, I can clearly say that culturally what is good for one can be bad for one from the other culture. So this is very local thing to call one thing good or bad according to the culture. They are not absolute. This is essentially respecting the culture. In that sense, there is not good and bad in reality, whereas at a much deeper sense, there is no good and bad. So Krishna also gives in Bhagavad-Gita some simple principles of good and bad. But finally, he gives another definition which is a much more encompassing definition. This is, “That which helps the sustenance is good, that which promotes destruction is bad”. Wherever we can adapt the good and the bad in a society of that society, or culture, or whatever it is, it is fine because that culture has not come to you; you have gone to that culture.</span><br/><span>Take for example the few things in certain parts of India. There are certain things which are good or bad, but the moment you come to Prashanti, there are different goods and bads. So Prashanti has defined good and bad one way. That definition of good and bad in Prashanti is to develop that kind of an environment and an atmosphere which is necessary for people to grow certain things of life. If I go to Prashanti, I can get what Prashanti can offer to me, and adapt to the good and bad of Prashanti. I adapt these things so that I can get the best of Prashanti. If I’m in a car, the moment I sit in the car in the driver’s seat, I have some goods and bads there, some thing right and some thing wrong, and I need to respect, and the moment I respect, then the car will help me. So we should have that flexibility to accept, but they are not absolute. Absolute bad is that where you clearly see that the end point is destruction and if it is going to sustain and not cause destruction then it is good. That definition of good and bad will help us to take world much better way.</span><br/><br/><span>QUESTION: But sometimes destruction can bring something that is good.</span><br/><br/><span>That is right. I mean the destruction and the sustenance in the long run. I destroy a bacterium for life to survive because the badness of the bacteria is that it not only destroys the other, but it also gets destroyed in the process. Let me make it a little clearer. For example, take the case of a bacterium. The bacterium is actually surviving in that person. But in the process it destroys that person and when the person is not there, the bacterium also gets destroyed, too. Whatever that is sustained. What is the badness of cancer? The cancer cell destroys a person who is responsible for its own growth. This is bad because it is self-destructive. This has to be understood from a deeper perspective.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>A</span><br/><br/><span>Ishavasya Upanishad is one of the important ten Upanishads. . It is the first one that really approves Karma Yoga. And the Bhagavad-Gita elaborately talks about Karma Yoga. “Karma” means “work”; and “yoga” means “peace of mind”. So karma yoga is the methodology by which the work we do can take us to peace of mind. But karma is also used for a different meaning. People also refer to karma basically meaning the past activity we have done and its effect; to say that something is karmic; like why were you born in Turkey and not in America? It is my karmic aspect. Why do I have to go through the suffering? It is karmic. But when we have a great pleasure and happiness, then it is not karmic. Then we easily say, “I’ve struggled hard! I struggled and earned and put all the effort in that work”. Whereas when a suffering occurs, when something bad occurs, then we say it is karmic. If you hit somebody, that is your effort. Somebody hits you it is karmic. That is why “karma” is used very conveniently, so we need to understand what karma basically is.</span><br/><span>The second aspect is how karma can give us peace of mind? All agitations, disturbances and the stress all appear because of karma. Activity we feel brings about disturbance. This is the reason when somebody says ‘peace of mind’ people equate it to giving up work. When we simply say that we have to calm down the mind, listeners immediately react saying “if I calm down my mind, how I can work? And how can the work run if we keep quiet?” But that means that karma is the action that is responsible for our problems. And there is no way that I can come out of this activity, so there is no possibility for having peace of mind while I am engaged in work. Do you understand this basically? This is the first secret that Karma Yoga addresses us. It is not the action that is the problem; the problem is something else. Let me give a simple example in the form of a story to illustrate this point.</span><br/><span>The idea of yoga is doing some thing extra ordinary. It should be like some thing challenging. How can simply doing an activity give us the benefits of yoga? Just as doing some humanly impossible rigors of discipline, and torturous practices on he body and mind etc are the ones which gives us the benefits of yoga, no pain no gain situation, how can ordinary activity give us the same benefits?</span><br/><span>Just to show that it is not some thing very non-human you are expected to do a classical story is there.</span><br/><span>Yoga can be in normal work! A saint by name Kaushik was sitting in the forest under a tree meditating deeply. A bird on the braches above was making noise which is natural for the bird. The sage Kaushik got disturbed from his meditation and with anger he looked at the bird with scorching eyes. The very angry looks burnt the bird and it fell dead on the ground.</span><br/><span>Kaushik though felt sorry for the bird, on the other hand he was surprised at the power to burn the bird he acquired through the meditation and was proud too!</span><br/><span>As his meditation got disturbed he found that he was hungry. He walked to a nearby house to ask for food and stood in front of the house and asked for food. It is the tradition those days that it is the responsibility of the society to take care of the needs of a student and a spiritual seeker engaged in meditation. But they are supposed to ask in humility and not in arrogance. When he stood in front of a house and asked for food the house wife came with all respect and wanted to take care of the saint at the door steps. But she found at the same time her husband walks in and she invariable has to take care of his immediate needs as a devout wife. She therefore apologized to the saint saying, “Sir, I would like to take care of you. Please give me some time wait for about ten minutes. Let me take care of him and come back to attend to you”. With he words Kaushik felt irritated, “how can she neglect me in front of her ordinary husband when a great yogi like him who accomplished a great power is standing there. But he controlled himself for the time being and waited. On top of all this she took little more time than he expected. When she came out she sincerely apologized saying, “I am sorry I made you to wait”. But his anger did not subside. She apologized repeatedly. But the arrogance will not allow one to act with compassion.</span><br/><span>When she found he did not change in spite of her repeated requests and also saying that it was no intentional and she could not help the situation, she said, “oh sir, come on give up the angry looks,” and she further added, “I am not the bird to fall pray to your anger like the bird in the forest”.</span><br/><span>He was shocked to hear from her about the bird being burnt because he never expected that any one would know about an incident that happened between him and the bird in the forest where no other person was there. How could he believe she knows about it? How could she know if she does not have any yogic powers? He felt her power must be greater than the power he has to burn a bird just by the heat rays from his angry looks. The moment he realized that she is extra ordinary at once he fell at her feet and prayed her to pardon his ignorance and requested her to tell what kind of yogic practices she does so that she acquired such great powers. She simply smiled and said, “I don’t do any spiritual practices and all that I do is to do my household activity diligently and meticulously”. But he could not believe and thought she is hiding about his practices. She in turn replied, “If you want any more information please go to my guru, his name is Dharma vyaadha and he is in the next town, and find out from him”.</span><br/><span>Kaushik then proceeded to the town in search of the guru she has referred to him. Expecting to see a great spiritual teacher may be having an ashram or a place like that, he looked around in the center of the town. To his surprise he saw no ashram or no sign board of a spiritual master around there but to his surprise he found a butcher shop with the sign board saying ‘Dharmavyaadha meat shop’. He thought it can not be because he is expecting to see a pious man and not a meat selling person.</span><br/><span>As he was hesitating standing there the person in the shop called him, ‘hi gentle man, aren’t you Kaushik and aren’t you the person the lay next village suggested you to meet me. I am the Dharmavyaadha you are looking for.’ Kaushik was totally dumb founded as how could he know what happened between him and the lady next town. But he could not do any thing. He remained as a mute spectator as he found to his surprise the guru is cutting meat and selling meat collecting money and fighting with them for the money! After he finished the work in the shop he counted all the money and took Kaushik wit him to his home. There he took care of his parents joyfully and at the end he asked him, ‘yes gentle man, what I can do for you?’ having seen all the work he is doing yet having such great wisdom, he is now totally surprised and asked him ‘sir, what is the special sadhana or spiritual practice you do so that you are such a great master. Dharmavyaadha replied humbly, ‘all that I do is to do all the duties that I am supposed to do diligently. That is my meditation’.</span><br/><span>Right attitude of work can make it worshipThe moral of the story is that when we are doing the normal day to day work with a special attitude, then the work itself is no inferior to the highest spiritual sadhana. The question now is about the attitude, which can transform our activities into sadhana or spiritual practices!</span><br/><span>Let me give you another anecdote how the attitude in the work can change the complexion of it.</span><br/><span>There is temple that is coming up in a village. And there are several people working in this temple cutting and carving the stones and make some nice, wonderful sculptures. A press reporter goes to these persons and wants to interview. This lady reporter goes and finds a person who is cutting the stones. She asks him, “What are you doing?”</span><br/><span>He replies with lot of anger, “Don’t you see that I am cutting the stone? And it’s a hard stone. Look at my hands! They became red. Beating the stone is like hell. And I would like to find some hole to slip away and rest, but the manager is always looking at me. He knows that I am a person who runs away from work. The whole work is like hell. And on top of it, you come and ask me if the work is really a problem. Cutting stone is really a horrible job. I feel I am cursed to do this. How I wish I could come out of this whole wretched work!” the press person asks the question, “ I see you are cutting the stone, but let me know what is coming up here!” he replies for that saying I don’t know why they are making this road and I am not even interested to know!</span><br/><span>So she goes to the second person and asks him, “What are you doing?” He says, “I’m cutting the stone here. It’s my job. I work for a definite eight hours for ten dollars; I have my wife and children. It’s a burden for me, but I have to take care of them. This is just a duty I am doing.” She asks him, “Do you know what is coming up here?” He says, “Yeah, they say that there is a temple coming. We do all the work for the temple. Whether it is a temple or jail, whatever it is, how it matters, I just do my duty for eight hours and then I go away from here. I have nothing to do with them.”</span><br/><span>Then she goes to the third person. He is also cutting the stones. Then she asks him, “What are you doing?” He answers, “I’m building a temple. In this village, there was no temple for years. Every time there was a temple festival, all these people had to go to the next village. My grandfather tried it for a lifetime to get a temple here. It remained as a dream. My father tried so much, but in his lifetime, it did not happen. It could not have happened in my lifetime as well. By the power and the grace of God, in my lifetime, this temple is coming up. You know, every time I hit the stone I hear such a wonderful music. And look at the way that everything is like a festival ever since that this temple started. This temple brought the whole village together. The temple made this sleepy village into festive mood.” She asks, “How long do you work on this temple?” He says, “Why do you ask how long? As soon as I get up in the morning, I come to this temple, and I start cutting the stones. I eat, drink, and do everything here. Even when I go home in the night, in my sleep, and even in my dream I’m cutting the stones, I dream of this temple. And that’s really enjoyable.”</span><br/><span>“When will you finish this temple work?” He replies, “Why are you asking when we’ll finish? I’m sad that this temple work is finishing and I’ll not have anything to do once this temple is completed. I wish I could continue doing this temple work for a long time, and bring in many more facilities around this temple. It’s a blessing.”</span><br/><span>When you look at the work, all three are doing the same work, but for the first person it is hell, and for the second person, it is a duty. However, for the third person, it is a blessing. If the work has the qualities inherently the goodness and badness, then these three should not have been feeling the same. But that is not the reality. The work itself does not carry these qualities. Then what is that which makes so much of difference? It is not the work which is disturbing our mind but it is some thing subtle.</span><br/><span>Work is external. Attitude is internal. Work belongs to the world. Attitude belongs to you. You cannot change work much because it is in the hands of the world out side! When it happens to change, fine, it happens. But attitude behind the work is in your hands. A certain attitude makes your work miserable and certain other attitude makes it pleasant. Change the attitude, and you will become spiritual. If you do not have the right attitude, you are non-spiritual.</span><br/><span>What you do vs how you do It is not the work that determines whether you are spiritual or not. This point needs to be understood very deeply. In fact, we have such stories in Indian philosophy. A woman can even work as a prostitute, but she can be an extraordinary saint. It is not because of the kind of work she is doing, but the kind of attitude she has. Attitude is in your hands and that is a thing you can change. Nobody can force an attitude on you. People can only influence your attitude, but it is you who decides what attitude you should have. And the right kind of attitude can help you turn it into yoga.</span><br/><span>When you look at it this way, yoga is not doing a few postures. I have seen some people who have a wonderful body, which can bend in so many ways, but they cannot bend their attitude. They can hold their breath until eternity, but they cannot hold their greed, their arrogance etc even to a small degree!</span><br/><span>Now what is yoga and what is not yoga? What appears like yoga may not be yoga. There are many yoga teachers that we come across who do not have the right kind of an attitude, they can bend very well and twist very perfectly yet they are not in true sense yogis because they don’t have right attitude. So karma yoga is not the work outside. It is essentially the attitude behind the work that we do. An attitude that takes toward peace of mind is a healthy attitude. An attitude, which brings about agitations of the mind, is not a yogic attitude. It is a worldly attitude. We have a wonderful ashram Prashanti. You have nice activities going on there. But you may have a few people there who have a wrong attitude. This can happen and does happen in many places. Such a person comes to the doorstep of something which can really help him. Yet he can not take the benefit of it. It is as if you take a spoonful of food and bring it close to your mouth, but you put not in the mouth but in the nose. You suffer. It is not the work that causes suffering but you and you attitude. If a right attitude is there, the work can give you peace of mind. If a right attitude is not there, then the work can cause tension to you. Now, let me give you a few tips as to how we can acquire different attitudes. Once you go to the depths, you have hundreds of things that are there in understanding the karma yoga, but because of the short time maybe we can discuss just a few things.</span><br/><span>If you consider the activity, the first step is that there may be such activities that can harm others, and disturbs others. Then those persons may in revenge disturb me. If I hurt somebody, that person will hurt me back. If I tell lies and misguide somebody, that person might misguide and hurt me. Thereby I suffer, and I say, “Look, I’m suffering!” Then one asks, “Why are you suffering?” “I misguided that man and now he disturbs me.” A simple solution for that thing is, ‘do not cause evil to others! If you do not do evil to others, they will not disturb you. This does not even require spiritual knowledge. It is at a very simple moral level knowledge. At a very simple moral level, it is said, “Do good for others and don’t do bad. Be right; don’t be wrong. Help, don’t hurt”. This does not require the teachings. But there is one subtle point we need to understand here. We should not hurt, not because that person should not be hurt. The hurt that you give, you will get it back. That is one of the physical laws. The physical law says, action and reaction, cause and effect are equal and opposite. The cause and the effect are related. That is what the physical law says. Like in a simple example we see, if I eat bad food, my stomach gets upset. This is a very simple law; it is called a physical law. We understand it in a simple way. This physical law which says, what you do has cause and effect relationship. This is called as ADHI-BHUTA.</span><br/><span>WHAT YOU SOW YOU REAP Whatever that I do, I get the benefit, the result of it. I do bad, so I get a bad result. You can see it right away. If I jump from the eighth floor of the building, I will die or I will break my limbs. I cannot say that I do not know why God is unkind to me. I cannot say my Karma is bad. You cannot blame anybody. You have been wrong. You have got wrong in return. This is a physical law. The physical law, the cause, and the effect are related.</span><br/><span>Logically it is OK. What you sow, you will reap. This is one of the simple things in Karma Yoga. Never do anything bad to anybody. Do not even think bad of anyone. Even that can cause a ricochet effect. Try to do good. But then the next question comes: “I always try to do good, but I get bad.” It is like a person who drives rash on the road, or a person who drives in the wrong direction and has an accident. He has done wrong so he got the result. So simply, do not drive in the wrong way. Do not drive in a rash way, and you will not have an accident. But I am driving in the right direction, and I am not driving rash, yet suddenly someone comes from the opposite direction and in the wrong way and hits me. He is hurt because he is wrong, but why should I suffer a hurt? What mistake have I done? Do you see what it means? I have been good but I receive bad. This is a situation we come across. If it is the good people who suffer then they ask the question, “Why do we suffer in spite of us being good?”</span><br/><span>Now consider this argument. An accident is a physical law. The moment we say it is a physical law; it has a cause and an effect. You are hurt physically, which basically means that there is a cause and effect connection. Accordingly the physical law can have two different dimensions. One dimension is that physically both the vehicles collided and so I am hurt. This does not consider whether you are in right direction or wrong. Physically both vehicles collided and so the accident took place. The second dimension is the subtle one. It is why I should suffer when I have done every thing right. This can be answered as chance which means there is no connection to whether you are right or wrong. It is just a chance. But this explanation can not help us to introspect and also this take apposition that what ever happens is a chance and we have no freedom or a say in such matters. There is another way of looking at. It also has a cause and effect connection because this is also a physical happening and it has to have the cause and result. In other words you created cause some time back and the effect you are receiving now! It can be possible that the cause and the effect may be immediate. But many times it can also be spaced at a long gap, or the cause and the effect may be very far away. The cause and the effect may be distanced so far apart that your perception may not reach. The distance may be both in terms of space and time!</span><br/><span>Our memory and our perception have a certain limit and limitations. We often do not know what we did thirty, forty years ago. In fact, when you look at your own photographs of four years age, you cannot recognize yourself. You start wondering, “Is this me?” and that basically means that our memory does not go that far. ‘Memory does not go far’ does not mean that the events that took place do not exist. The cause and the effect may be beyond your memory, but they are related. If you plant a mango seed, it takes twelve years to get the fruit. You might think that the seed you planted is of a wonderful, beautiful, tasty mango, but at the seed level, you cannot tell the difference. However, twelve years later when the fruit comes, it is a tasteless horrible mango. Then you start saying, “I planted a wonderful mango seed and I got a bad fruit.” How can that be? What you have planted you have got. This law cannot be violated. Just because your memory does not reach that far, it does not mean that the cause is not there. Because it is a physical law it can not have an exception.</span><br/><span>There is a tribe in Africa I heard. Because of some local genetic conditions, this tribe has a memory not longer than six months. They can only think of things that are six months old, and they do not know what happened beyond that. That is as to how the people of this tribe make a connection between sex and childbirth. That connection is a minimum nine months, but since their memory does not go that far, they think that sex is a different part of life and that the child is god-given. It is not because there is a cause and effect relation, but because the cause and the effect are placed beyond the memory. According to Indian philosophy, the effort can bear results not only in this life; it can be after this life. You plant the seeds now, but you reap the fruits later. The “later” may be this life or maybe the next. This is what is called as “karma”. So when we say “karma”, it is not that somebody else is responsible; you are responsible. Then the student asks what the advantage of this hypothesis is. How can we utilize this knowledge? As a result of this knowledge when something bad happens, we do not blame anybody else. We know that it is our own actions, which have given the fruits. Yet I can decide through my actions and attitude what fruits I will have in the future, and not only in the future but in the life after this one. So from now on whatever activity I do, I never plan anything wrong to anybody, so that I shape my future which can be free from agony.</span><br/><span>THE STORY OF BUDDHAOne day Buddha went to a house and begged for some food. This is normal for a sanyasin, who has taken to the spiritual life in India. His requirements are very small: some food and few clothes. They do not have any attachments to anything. Buddha was a big king and he became a sanyasin. And then his requirement is just a morsel of food. Sanyasins do not have houses where food is cooked because it becomes an attachment. So the culture goes that these people go to a house and ask the house lady for food. So Buddha went to a house and asked for food. The lady, respecting the culture, wanted to offer food to him. She opened the door but then she saw a well-built, robust forty-year old man in good health. Obviously she did not recognize him so she at once got annoyed and started shouting at Buddha, “why are you begging food? Can you not earn? Why don’t you work at some place and earn your food? Why should you beg for it? You are a lazy fellow!” After she shouted all that at him, she slammed the door on his face. Buddha’s disciple Ananda heard all this and got angry. He told Buddha, “Why did you keep quiet? Look, you are the king of this place. If she is eating food, it is because of the king’s grace. Why did you allow her to shout at you?” Buddha smiled. “Maybe in some previous life I shouted at her. I’m glad that this debt is cleared now. I don’t want to shout at her now, so that I don’t create a fresh balance. She shouted at me and went back, and now I’m peaceful.”</span><br/><span>Adhi Bhuta,</span><br/><span>Adhi Daiva This basically shows how one’s behavior changes. So karma philosophy is not blaming somebody but seeing how one’s future has been planned. It gives a person a big relief. This is called adhidaiva. So the first one is the adhibhuta, we are responsible for what happens to us because we see immediately or in the immediate future which is in our memory range. The second is adhidaiva, which is beyond our memory, may be this life or may be in the previous but we are responsible. There is a third force called adhyatma. Bhagavad-Gita says that it is our own nature. Adhibhuta is not spiritual; adhidaiva is also not spiritual, because they are cause and effect related, so it is bound, whereas adhyatma is a spiritual force, and that spiritual force is our nature. What is that?</span><br/><span>Even good activity can give miseryEvery activity has these three forces as components. The first component is ‘you do right, and then you get the right back’. Second thing is, ‘you get the benefit, and you get the result from the past, and take it as it comes. Consciously eliminate any activity which can result into bad karma to you’. And the third and the most important aspect is adhyatma, which means we have that freedom psychological that whatever happens to us, we are free to worry or not, to get disturbed by that or not’, and that freedom is the spiritual force within us. We all have that. It is our nature – called swabhava. A situation may be bad, but how to take that situation is in my hands. To get disturbed by the situation or not to get disturbed by it and to use it in the right way is a wonderful force of freedom. It is in our hands. The lady shouts, but the smile at her is the freedom that Buddha exercises. That is the spiritual knowledge within us. Once you have that in your hand, show me what can disturb you? There is nothing in this world that can disturb you. If somebody hurts you, equipped with this knowledge you can smile at him. If somebody slaps you on the cheek; you can turn the other cheek. We all have that freedom. If you apply this freedom even one per cent, you have a one per cent saint in you. You have become a Buddha; you have become a Christ for that moment, and this is our freedom. This is Karma Yoga. If we do good and don’t do anything bad even then we may have the problem of agony. It is because we do good and we now expect the results. If the good does not pay the results expected, it becomes our agony. This is the next subject noticed by the student. Let me tell another real life incident. You know Madras in India. There was a slum area. In these slums most often people do not keep their houses clean. A group of youngsters, who were really charged for doing something good, wanted to do good in that area. They went there and saw that the streets and the people were dirty. There was a lot of work to do. So they wanted to do selfless work. They cleaned the streets and the houses, and showed the people how to clean the dirt why to keep clean and live a life of hygiene. They collected all the garbage, threw it out, and gave baths to the kids. In the end, the kids were looking neat; the streets were neat. The time from morning to evening was spent usefully and they were happy. “See we did good work,” they said. They had peace of mind.</span><br/><span>The same group of youngsters came again to the same place the next week, and they found the place is as it was before and back in dirt. Yet they consoled themselves, saying “People will not learn it in one day. Maybe if we do this, another two-three weeks, people will slowly learn.” So the following Wednesday, they did the whole thing once again. They cleaned the whole place, disposed of the garbage, gave baths to the kids. Everyone was wonderful and happy. The next week they went there one more time and found the place no different. But they were still not tired. The same enthusiasm was there. They cleaned the whole place, did everything nice. People were happy; the students were happy. Then they went back. Then for the following Wednesday there were some important problems in some other part of the city. Since the students had to go there they could not come to the first place for one or two weeks,. They did all that - Happy. Then once again, the following Wednesday after that, they went back to the same slum area. As soon as the local people in that slum area saw the youngsters, they asked them, with anger,” What happened to you last week? Why did you not come to clean?”</span><br/><span>Now you are frustrated. You say to yourself, “I taught them something good. I tried to do good, but the good did not pay the result. The results are not coming forth. The people do not realize” This frustrates us. The work has not frustrated, but not getting the result of the work frustrated us. What we then normally do is blame the work and say that we should not do this work since the work causes us frustration. Look at this subtly. Work itself did not frustrate you, because the first week we enjoyed it; the second week we enjoyed it, and now it has become frustration! If work caused the frustration, had it not have always frustrated you? However, it gave happiness before and how can it give frustration now! If the work is causing frustration then how could it give satisfaction before and why not now?</span><br/><span>Work itself does not cause frustration, but there is something else that causes frustration; that is the expectation of the results. The expectation of the results gives us frustration. We do the work with a good attitude, but the expectation of the results is the bad attitude. That is why Krishna gives us a golden rule: Give up the fruit of the work. ‘Ma phaleshu kadaacana’. Give up the desire for the results. Immediately we have a rebel within us for that very thought. The question rises if we do not expect any results, then why do we do or why do we have to do the work? Here, we need to understand the nature of work from a deeper perspective.</span><br/><span>When you closely watch we see that we have good intention for doing good. If it is not there then you are not even fit for spiritual knowledge. Spirituality does not start if you have not arisen from bad to good! And a simple moral education is sufficient to make one to come towards doing good to others from doing bad. Therefore in the first place a spiritual person tends to do good to others. He plans and starts working towards that. From the time he starts doing he enjoys the activity. Doing bad has vengeance or venom behind it and that it is crippling and causing pain. He has come out of all that negativity the moment he comes out of doing bad. You were happy as you are doing the good work. That means your inner self was happy by doing good. But as we progress we start expecting results. The expectation of results is outside. Joy of doing the work is internal and very satisfying. But the moment your focus is outside you are disturbed. As long as your focus is inside, you are happy. The moment you turn your focus outside, you are unhappy. Therefore, expecting results brings you out of your personality. You start becoming anxious and frustration for seeing the results and disappointments if they do not give expected results. Even then the objection sustains. You say, “I did good work and the good work should give a good result”. You start wondering why there has been failure. You loose your faith in good work also. It appears good work may not have desired fruits.</span><br/><span>GOOD ACTION HAS GOOD RESULTSPlease understand there is nothing wrong with good work and good work has the result. You may not be able to see. Yes, the work has the result. You do not have the result. The result does not belong to you. The result belongs to the work itself. The fruits belong to the root. What the seed is, so is the fruit. The fruit belongs to the seed, and not to you.</span><br/><span>Be assured that every good work has a good fruit. However, it might not show the results today. Do you not see that good has a good flow of activity? People did good activity not because they wanted to see the good result. In fact, for doing good activity, many people meet with such horrible obstacles. A person who did good work has been given poison and another is crucified. Yet if the activity is good, it is going to bear good fruits one day. Socrates was given poison for the good message he spread. Jesus Christ was crucified for the compassion he spread. If we consider the activity and if he was interested in seeing the result, Jesus Christ was a failure, but look what happened after two thousand years? People follow Christ. Have that conviction. Any good work that you do is not a waste. It may have fruit some time, yet you may not be there to see it. You should not worry inside about seeing the fruits. Your efforts should be for the good.</span><br/><span>Krishna gave Gita for Arjuna in the battlefield five thousand years ago. Even then Arjuna was not satisfied and not totally reformed by that. If Krishna would have cared only for Arjuna, he would have been a miserable person after giving the whole of Gita to Arjuna. He would have been depressed. “Such a wonderful message I have given. Nobody has benefited by that.” Krishna never looked at the benefit. He wanted to give a good message, and that is why this same message is vibrantly living after five thousand years.</span><br/><span>In America, I was working with psychiatric patients. One very wealthy billionaire lawyer lady came to me for psychological support. I told her some ideas with which she was very happy. Then I told her that this idea is from a text called Gita. Her face brightened. “How wonderful this text is! How wonderful this idea is,” she exclaimed. She was really blissful, but then she became depressed and asked me, “You say that this idea is from Gita, and Gita is a Hindu text whereas I am a Christian. How can I apply this?” I said, “Krishna did not have the idea for one particular race or for one particular person. His message is for the mankind. If it is useful, take it. If it helps you take out of your problem, please use it.” She was so grateful for that thought. She realized it is not to convert one from one faith to the other but it to help mankind from his/ her misery</span><br/><span>Our good is not dependent on a person, a race, or on an area. Our good is for the mankind. Good has no boundaries. The moment good work is attached with an agenda wanting someone to get converted then the good work lost its importance to conversion and that is no more a good work. Goodness of good work becomes secondary and our other agenda becomes primary. A good work does not have any boundaries. Only with the expectation of results, we create boundaries. When Krishna said ‘don’t think of the results’, he never meant that good results were not going to come. His idea was ‘don’t create a boundary around goodness’. The thing which has no boundary is called as the divine (Ananthata= infinite). This is Karma Yoga. Karma Yoga tells us to do the good activity and not to look at the results.</span><br/><span>EGO OF GOOD WORK IS BADBut there is one more step Krishna wants us to recognize and it will take us one more step ahead.</span><br/><span>Despite the fact that there is no visible result that you expected, do not become depressed. The assurance is that the result is going to be there anyway. Then the second objection when we start thinking is: “What a wonderful, good work I’m doing. I am not even expecting results, but I am doing good work.” This doing good work can become our ego. This is the evil about the good work. A person who does bad work is saved from this evil anyway. A person who does bad work is not egoistic, but a person who does good work can become egoistic. We have to be careful with that. Who are you to do good work? You can never do good work. Good work is always there in this world. You can only become a part of the good work that has been going on. I tell the truth. Truth is always there. Millions of people have been telling truth, and the truth is supporting them. The same way, you are also telling the truth. You can be egoistic of goodness if you start thinking you are doing good work. Subtly seeing you can only join the good forces that are there in this world. Even before the untruth took birth, truth was there. So truth is something which is eternal. The good work is eternal. It is like a river that flows all the time, perennial. Your good work is like taking a dip in that river. Be humble. Be humble that you are given a chance to be good. Good is going on, and you are associated with that. Thank God that you have become part of the good force that is going on. This attitude takes away the ego of goodness, which is much more dangerous.</span><br/><span>There is another important aspect of Karma Yoga. Whether good or bad, I will do the work. I can think good. I can plan good. I can organize good. I do so many wonderful things. This has to be eliminated. Consider the simple fact that I am giving this message. I could be egoistic. But many people have already said what Krishna also said all that knowledge has come to me consciously and unconsciously and from me to you. You are fortunate that you have intelligence. You are fortunate that you are able to put these things together. How can you therefore be egoistic about it and claim the ownership of the knowledge?</span><br/><span>Three gunasThere are several external agencies responsible in all these activities and it is you are fortunate so you are able to give. For example, if you had mental retardation, what would you have done? Or if people had not passed on this information to you, will you have created it? Therefore, do an activity but do not be the doer behind it. Do not give up doing the activity just because you are not a doer. This is the essence of Karma Yoga.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another aspect of Karma Yoga. Karma means activity. God has created a variety of activities. They are absolutely unique, marvelous, and different. That is how the whole universe is created. Observe nature carefully. You will understand. Look at a plant. We have never looked at a plant leisurely. If you look patiently at a plant you can see the wonderful work going on there. The roots go to the ground, and we really do not know what and how they collect from the earth and ground. They untiringly work inside, absolutely in the darkness of the earth, and do not keep what they collect for themselves; they relentlessly pass it on. There is also a stem, the plant portion. It holds the plant tight, has a hard outer cover to protect the plant from external attacks from the creatures outside, and passes on this wonderful message up the plant. Then on the top, you can see the wonderful leaves, foliage, and the flowers shining in the sky. We look at the leaves, the foliage and flowers, and see how beautiful the tree is, and how wonderful it looks; and we see that as a tree. However, leaves are there for a few months until the fall comes, when we see all are gone. It looks as if the tree is dead, but when the tree is dead, when the whole leaves are gone, all that you see is the dry branches sticking out dead like, yet it is still the roots that hold the life. The roots have all the patience. They patiently wait for the next sun to come. They patiently wait for the next spring to come. They give total assurance to the plant: do not worry. You will once again carry that beauty and give fresh leaves and flowers. Those roots do such a wonderful sacrifice. Thus, each part is doing its own job in this plant.</span><br/><span>The plant is divided into three different aspects for the sake of our convenience; the roots, the stem and the flowers and foliage. In a plant all these things are necessary for its existence. The manifestation might have taken place separately but the intelligence of roots; stem and foliage are always available. For the sake of understanding they are given the identity as sattva, rajas and tamas. The flowers and foliage are called as sattva; the trunk is called as rajas; and, the roots under the ground are called as tamas. These three divisions namely sattva, rajas and tamas can be found in the whole creation. You can find the same description in the whole of manifested world. Just look at a human being. He has feet always on the ground, and carrying the weight of the whole body and help you climb up and down the stairs. The feet never complain that you have so much weight although they themselves are on the ground all the time. What the feet do is a selfless work. That is the tamas aspect of us.</span><br/><span>The middle portion of the body, which holds the body together, and which distributes the food everywhere and cleans the blood all the time, is called the rajas. Then we have the head where you see, think, enjoy, plan, scheme, and imagine: a totally different kind of activity. This is called the sattva. So in our body we also have rajas, tamas, and sattva. </span><br/><span>The leaves, the flowers, the fruits, the sky, and the fresh air, are all sattva. The stem the braches are all rajas. So also any thing hard and working all the time holding together like the way a trunk holds the tree together protects all are rajas and the roots buried all the time under the cover if the soil which does not see the light of the day and the putrefied, decomposed food which is the food of the roots darkness where the roots are always are all tamas. Darkness also means not having knowledge not seeing the brightness of life all are tamas. Tamas also means therefore darkness. Similarly there are these activities which are called the sattva, rajas, and tamas. Soft, gentle, quiet activities are sattvic. The activity of the nature of constantly supplying and distributing the material from the roots to the whole of plant and holding the plant together and protecting all are rajasic activity. There is also another activity which is tirelessly going on doing monotonous work not seeing the light of the day, hard, constantly pressurized labor kind of activity, which is tamas. Thus, the creation is made out of all these three different kinds. This is how the whole creation can be looked at it is made up of these three gunas namely sattva, rajas, and tamas. Krishna says, “Look at all these three things.” This is how basically nature and activity can be explained into three different kinds.</span><br/><span>Unfortunately most of the spiritual texts set sattva, rajas, and tamas into a hierarchy, saying that sattva is very good and wonderful, and that we all should go to sattva, whereas rajas is bad, and tamas is horrible. This is how most of the texts have translated, but it appears to me in a different way. Each is important and each is doing its own work wonderfully. If you say sattva is good, being in the fresh air, and the flowers and foliage are good, and you take the roots and keep it in the sky trying to make it sattva, the plant will die. Similarly, if you say, “Why do my feet have to carry the body all the time? Let the feet also be in the space outside. Let me use my feet in thinking because I would like my feet to do sattvic activity. Therefore, I will stand on my head.” That’s not right. Each has to do its own job. Sattva has to happen in a sattvic way. Rajas has to work in a rajasic way. Tamas has to work in a tamasic way. Not only that, only when sattva is recognized and provided the chance to manifest its natural state of sattva it is going to be in bliss, and same way rajas is recognized as rajas and provided the opportunity to manifest rajas naturally it will be pleased, and tamas needs the same way recognition.</span><br/><span>In the human beings also there are three categories of people. It is not that a person who is of one quality does not manifest other qualities but basically one or the other qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas will be predominant and others will be supporting that major quality. We may have all these three, but one of these qualities can be dominant in us. Some people have sattva as predominant quality. These are people engaged in thinking, planning, and scheming which are basically sattvic activities. Whereas people who are rajas by nature can protect and organize an army of people for giving protection or for running an organization or a country due to their very nature. They are also people who can distribute things and do trade just like the way the middle portion of our body does. These are people who belong to the category of kings and traders. It is their very nature to be able to do that. Sattvic people are like our head by nature. They think and organize. Rajasic people are like our trunk or stomach portion which protects and organizes the food etc. There is also a fourth category of people who are like our feet. They can do heavy work. They do the labor work and we should be able to appreciate their activity. They are like our feel which carries the weight of the body without any complaint from morning to night. We can not say that tamasic activities are inferior activities and thinking and planning are superior activities. We are here to improve the world and make them go from tamas to rajas and then ultimately to sattva. That is the way we can improve the mankind. Therefore in order to improve a person we should make one to do sattvic activity and take him out of tamas activities. By making them to do these activities they are not suitable for such sattvic activity, actually you are giving them trouble. A scientist is a sattvic person. But if a scientist says, “All right, let me start a business,” he will be a failure. Business requires a different frame of mind. It is a rajasic mind. A professor is a sattvic person. If you put him in the army, he will be a failure. He can only think in a way of a scientist. The other day I heard an incident.</span><br/><span>During a state of emergency in a country they wanted to have many people in army and they were recruiting all eligible adults were being recruited in army. A professor was drafted into the army and during the training period the captain was giving orders. They were learning to march and the captain was ordering, “Left right, left right. Right turn. Left turn… And left turn. And another right turn’. The professor stood. He did not move with the others. The captain came to him and asked, “Why don’t you join the march?” The professor asked the captain, “You first decide which way to go. Then I will move. You are constantly changing, right turn, left turn and all that.” The professor cannot understand that. By nature, he is a different person.</span><br/><span>Similarly, there is a fourth category of people who are laborers, and we have to have respect for them. What they do is a wonderful job. If you ask a professor to do the labor job, he will be a failure, whereas certain people are there for work like that. Understanding their nature, putting them to the kind of work that they are suited to would be a wonderfully harmonious match. The work which is harmonious for you, and the activity which harmoniously blends with your nature does not become a burden.</span><br/><span>I was having a colleague in my office. He is a trained engineer but he is basically tamasic in nature. He was happy doing preparing the reports work which really does not require any brain but it is simply collecting the data from one report and reorganizing into another report. He was never tired doing such repetitive activity without any complaint. He does not worry why is he doing that work where that report is going to go or is there any other way of simplifying the repetitive monotonous work. Many of us were wondering how can he do it that we could not have done for such long time. It is alright for few days doing such repetitive work. Therefore these divisions namely the learned class, royal class, trader class, and the labor class are basically divided because of their innate quality of sattva, rajas, and tamas and generally speaking they come by birth in the family.</span><br/><span>Gandhi was a businessman by birth. The business spirit or the money matter was there in his blood from hereditary. To show how subtle this nature was, let me give an example that I heard some where from his life.</span><br/><span>Those days when freedom struggle was going on, he inspired the whole country by his talks. One day in Ahmadabad, he was giving a talk. There were thousands of people who assembled. It was in the night. First he inspired them for the national freedom struggle and then said that this required a lot of funds. He wanted to raise funds. People were really charged to participate in freedom struggle by giving donations. The organizers spread a white sheet on the stage. People came in a cue, and they were giving whatever money, jewelry they had, throwing it onto the white sheet. All the leaders were standing there. After all was collected, the leaders made a list of the things given. Gandhi was talking to somebody. They finished the counting and showed the list to him. Gandhi looked at the list, just glanced, and then asked them, “Have you taken everything?” They said, “Yes.” He asked again, “Did you not miss any small little thing?” They said, “No. Why don’t you check again?” thus he insisted. They started feeling a little annoyed. Because, you know, businessmen look into small things when the question of money is there. They do not even want to leave small things. He has become a national leader but he still has the quality of a businessman. They were a bit irritated. Realizing this, Gandhi said, “OK. Let’s go now.” Then they retired into the tent.</span><br/><span>Suddenly in the middle of the night, Gandhi came unto the stage with a small little lantern. When he was coming, the others also followed him. When he came unto the stage, he found a small stool standing in the corner. One little earring was lying underneath it. He picked up the earring and gave it to the man. “Please take this also carefully because I respect this. Whoever has given this thing must have really urged, pleaded God, that with this, the country should get freedom. That’s why this is very precious,” he said. Then they asked Gandhi, “We have really mistaken you, Gandhiji. How could you guess it and how did you know something must have gone there?” He said, “Naturally, people were coming from this direction, and when they threw their donation items, something could roll and fall in that direction. So I thought that we had not checked under the small table. That’s why I’ve come.” Then they asked him, “How did you know that something was missing?” This is a very businessman like attitude that comes into the picture. “When I was glancing at the list, I have seen the necklace and this and that. They were all alright but when I looked at the number of earrings, I thought that anybody would give two earrings, not one earring. So I should finally have an even number, not an odd number. When I looked at the number of earrings, it was an odd number. Then I thought something must be missing.”</span><br/><span>This is the attitude of a businessman. A businessman cannot miss this. Similarly some people by their very nature are leaders and protective. So Karma Yoga says ‘recognize one’s inner nature and give the right kind of work’. Do the work the way that it needs to be done, and then the work will not be a burden.</span><br/><span>Nature itself is not a bad it is a combination of sattva, rajas or tamas in a harmonious proportions. Neither sattva is bad, or rajas or tamas. They are what they are. In the journey of life we come across all these things namely sattva, rajas, and tamas. We are comfortable with what suits our nature and there is nothing right or wrong about it. Even the colors can be looked from the angle of sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Even the colors also have an appeal according to ones nature. That is why we like also colors accordingly and nothing wrong in that. One might wonder, how can somebody like those colors. It is only that their nature makes them to appreciate those colors!</span><br/><span>If every thing is fine, what is wrong and why suffering? Our suffering is due to our attachments. Our problem is our attachment with one or the other. If my nature is sattva I tend to do and choose things according to my nature called sattva and if my nature is rajas I do things and I like things which are rajasic in nature. This is perfect. But life does not always go on in one guna. Here and there once in a while we may have to shift from one guna to other guna according to the necessity. If I am attached to sattva, even when I have to do rajas or tamas, I still end up doing sattva way only due to my attachment. It is like an obsession in the body. A crude example can be if there is some problem in the body the sattvic way to manage is to just apply a balm, and the rajasic way is to give some harsh and painful drugs or application and tmasic way is to cut and do surgery. In case of a growth in the body where you really need a surgery if the surgeon says he is sattvic, he does everything in a sattva way only, even when he needs to cut open the body, take out the abscess, and take out the growth… it is an obsession and is not in harmony. This is wrong! </span><br/><br/><span>B</span><br/><br/><span>When I need to beat, I need to beat. When I can do it in a soft and gentle way, I should do that way. We should have this freedom. And this freedom is possible only if you do not have an attachment to any one of these natures.</span><br/><span>Sattva is good at some places and bad at some places but attachment to sattva is always bad. Rajas is also good on some situations and bad in some situations where as attachment to rajas is always bad. Tamas is also good in some situations and bad in other situations but attachment to tamas is always bad. Thus, yoga is non-attachment: non-attachment to all three gunas.</span><br/><span>Karma, akarma,</span><br/><span>vikarmaIf you have an attachment, you do it your own way. The result may be some times success and many times may be failure. But you still continue to do it your own way because of your attachment. Though from the point of view of the result of the activity, it may be successful but from the point of view of self it is always bad and non- spiritual because such an activity promotes our attachment only. Therefore what you do is not depended on what is the result but what is the state of the subject or self. If the subject is getting more and ore bound by his nature he is getting bound, if the person is not getting caught up in his own nature then it is freedom. If our focus is on outside it is worldliness and if the attention is self then it is spirituality. Whereas if you do not have an attachment, you can do what is right. One more concept of Karma Yoga and then we can stop.</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna gives one more idea of karma yoga in Gita:</span><br/><span>Different people have different explanations about the concept of karma, akarma, and vikarma about which Krishna says in Gita. It is often stated that karma is the rituals and the activities such as the performances of Yagana etc. and akarma is like the non action and the example they give is the axle which is behind the wheel. Finally vikarma is explained as the actions which are prohibited like violence, steeling and robbing, injuring some thing telling lies and series of activities of this nature which are essentially bad. I had difficulty in understanding this because Krishna need not say these things to Arjuna because Arjuna has already been good. he can not think of doing any thing of this sort. There is no reason Krishna has to tell him what is good activity and what is the bad activity and also advice him not to do bad activity and do only good activity. We don’t need spiritual knowledge to tell us to do good actions and not to do bad, to do right and not to do wrong. This is the roll of simple moral knowledge. It is not spiritual knowledge because spiritual knowledge is far beyond the moral knowledge. Arjuna has been highly moral and yet he is suffering. Therefore moral knowledge can not find a solution which he needed. Therefore in my point of view we need to look at it from a different angle at Vikarma different from moral angle so that we can get spiritual knowledge. Let me share with you this idea.</span><br/><span>According to Krishna in Gita, he says there are three things which he states as karma akarma and vikarma. These can be translated as action, non-action and reaction. It is easy to understand action and non-action but it is difficult to relate it with reaction.</span><br/><span>Action is fine, non-action is fine. He calls action as karma. When he says A+KARMA we can look at it as non+action. He says karma is fine, and that akarma is also fine. However he says, don’t do Vikarma. Now in this statement he brings the third concept called as Vikarma. It is unique with Gita. Vikarma is bad. Krishna says, that activity is OK, non-activity is also fine, but he also says, don’t do Vikarma.</span><br/><span>Vikarma puzzles us. We wonder what is it and how does it exist. When there is some thing to be done, you either do it or do not do it. You only have two alternatives. Here is a simple example. I am watching a football game. My wife is busy in the kitchen. And the child cries. Maybe he needs a diaper change. He cries. I tell my wife, “Take care of the kid.” She responds, “You take care of the kid as I am busy in the kitchen cooking!” I say “I am also busy and it is the duty of the mother and not the father to take care of the child”, I bring in law point. I now have two alternatives: I either do karma or akarma. I take care of child or I do not take care of him. I choose not to take care of him because I have an idea. It is not a man who should take care of the child. So I tell my wife, “I am busy here watching the football match. You take care of the kid.” I know in my heart also that it is only an excuse and I am not busy. I don’t have to see football match, after all what is there if I don’t watch football match!</span><br/><span>She says, “All right, I’ll take care of the kid, but you will not have lunch.” That is her triumph card. That is a problem for me now. Now what to do? I now feel no other alternative as I don’t want to miss the lunch!! Then very unwillingly I agree to take care of the kid with out one more word of argument, but deep inside, I feel angry. Why should I take care? I should not be doing this. I am a man. Men should not take care of children. Men only give birth for a child. All such arguments rise inside. Yet I still go and take care of him. I now angrily ask the child, “Yes, tell me what are you doing all this mess for”? Wife hears my harsh voice and says from in side the kitchen talk to him nicely, don’t be unkind. Now I can’t even be harsh so I stomach my anger and work! That way while I am doing an activity my inside is constantly telling me “don’t do”. This doing has a strong fight inside. This is defined as vikarma. Vikarma is essentially keeping the negativity and fighting inside while doing an activity. This fighting is roughly called as ‘reaction’. Krishna says that action is fine. Non-action is also fine, but this reaction is bad because the reaction disturbs your inner peace and harmony. Reaction is a poison in our body. Every reaction throws adrenalin in the body in an erratic way. Every reaction disturbs your body chemistry. Reaction is bad. Our action can be reaction. Even our non-action can be reaction. So reaction can manifest in the form of action as well as non-action. What we see outside is action or non-action but what is hidden behind is reaction. Action or non-action is only outer cover, but the spirit behind is reaction. Looking or caring for action or non-action is looking at the world but looking and caring for the reaction or the spirit behind is the spirituality.</span><br/><span>Now look at our twenty-four hours of the day and seven days of the week. How much time are you spending doing action, or non-action? And how much you are spending our time and energy in reaction?</span><br/><span>Suppose you have to get up early in the morning. No doubt you get up early morning as alarm rings and realize what the first thought that comes into your mind is: “Oh my God, I have to get up. I don’t want to get up. It is horrible. I shouldn’t go to that office.” But then you get up and go. You are on the road. You say to your self, “Horrible traffic! Everybody is on the road!” But you still travel. You reach office and there you find your boss and momentarily you say to yourself, “See, how horrible it is. Now I have to face him throughout the day”. Yet you smile and greet. Understand that in each of these actions every one of them is nothing but reaction only.</span><br/><span>Same way your non action is in true sense not non-action. You are resting. But you are not peacefully resting. Thought comes up, “if I don’t sleep, what will happen tomorrow? Should I get up and do this and this or should I just say let me do it tomorrow”. That sleep also has an agenda. Ninety per cent of our whole day is in the form of reactions. That is why we are in trouble. Krishna says, “Give up reaction.” Once you give up reaction then you will not have the problem of this fight within and the disharmony within. We feel that is alright but if I do not react how the other person can be set right? I have to get anger; I have to have my reaction and I can not give up reaction.</span><br/><span>Reaction causes disturbances in our body chemistry, it spoils the interpersonal relationship. Reaction creates negativity. Reaction is bad. Though it is bad if I don’t have reaction what do I do?</span><br/><span>The opposite of reaction is not ‘non-doing’ because reaction can manifest both in the form of doing and non-doing. Do not have reaction. Opposite to reaction is response! Your response helps the situation to become alright. Reaction many times may help the situation temporarily but on a long run it can hurt the situation also. Response unites where as reaction separates! Have response. Respond to the situation. Your response is what is important. Response has compassion and love, where as reaction is very mechanical, it does not have soul! Response is healthy where as reaction is not healthy to one self or even for the situation.</span><br/><span>Reaction has the tone i have a right to do this way or the other way. Reaction is basically based on our rights. I have a right to react. It is showing our right. The question choosing between reaction and response is actually between rights and responsibilities. These days, people talk so much about their rights that it is the most important thing in life. Individual rights constitutional rights, human rights children rights abuse of rights so on and so forth. From morning to evening we keep hearing about the rights.</span><br/><span>I was trying to find out what to call for rights in the Sanskrit based languages. Very surprisingly I found that there is no word equivalent in Sanskrit language for right, there is no word for right! Sanskrit language is one of the richest languages. It has so many words, which are not there in other languages. When Sanskrit could give us many words could they not have been given one more word called “right”? They wontedly carefully avoided the concept.</span><br/><span>They have not given a word for “right”. That is why none of the Indian languages born from Sanskrit has a word for “right”. In all Indian languages, we only use the word “haq” to express right, but “haq” does not have a Sanskrit origin. “Haq” has an Arabic origin. It must have been borrowed after the Muslim invasion of India which is as recent as 12th century or 13th century. But why did we borrow this word? Simple answer is we did not have a word called right. How could a culture survive for ten thousand years without a word called right! Or is it that because we did not have that word, the whole culture survived for a ten thousand years without a “right”. Please understand that this is very important issue. The culture survived not only without “haq”, but the culture survived because that there was no “haq”. Is it not that this haq is a great poison for the social harmony. Search for the whole Indian literature you will find references for responsibilities and nowhere there is reference for rights!</span><br/><span>We have no rights but we have responsibilities under Indian culture. During the whole period of Sanskrit literature for ten thousand years, nobody has a right. This we can not even imagine! The king has no rights. Subjects do not have any rights. Women have no rights, men have no rights. Parents have no rights. Children have no rights. But everybody has responsibilities. The king has a responsibility. The subject has a responsibility. The parents have responsibilities. Children have responsibilities. Why?</span><br/><span>A ‘rights’ divide you. If the parents say, “These are my rights” to the children, they are not one unit bout they are separating themselves out. The husband says, “These are my rights” to his wife, they don’t become a unit together but he is separating out. If a king says, “I have rights,” he is not one of the people. Whereas, on the other hand, if he says he has the responsibility he is part of the whole population. Like the way hands and legs are part of the body and try to survive and be happy collectively. Same way according to Indian philosophy a home or a town or a s kingdom all are living organisms like out body and various persons involved in this are various components sharing the responsibility of collective living. Father is not is not separate from the family. An individual is not separate from the society king is not separate from the kingdom. Rights separate and responsibilities unite. Everybody’s responsibility is to unite with the other. The parents have the responsibility to make the house beautiful. The children have the responsibility to make house beautiful. The king has the responsibility to make the country beautiful. The subjects have a responsibility to make the country beautiful. Responsibilities bring people together. Rights separate. Responsibility has yoga, reunion built in it. Rights separate us. That is why a culture which has responsibility as the root, is a culture which survives, which is time tested. A simple example: there are thirteen of us here. If we take responsibilities, it becomes simple. On the other hand if we sit and say, “This is my right, and this is my right,” we can only destroy.</span><br/><span>I only wish if these concepts of Karma Yoga spread in the world we may want this strong message that we should have a world society where everybody is responsible. What a wonderful world we can create. We have the responsibility to see the world will be with richness. Trees are rich, rivers are rich, forests are rich and every where there is richness. How can I do that? It is simple. Before I destroy any thing let me construct double of that. Before I take a leaf from a plant, let me give water to the plant so that it has two leaves.</span><br/><span>Responsibility comes from within. Responsibility has a satisfaction in itself where as rights are looking for the satisfaction elsewhere. A right has to be imposed from outside. A right requires constitution. Responsibility requires spirituality. We have this wonderful country India, for ten thousand years its culture was based on responsibility. This has been said all over the scriptures, and when we got freedom, our leaders wanted to write a constitution. They were very good and patriotic but they lacked the necessary spiritual attitude to look at the spiritual basis of this culture which survived this for ten thousand years intact if not more. The country was not only survived but was the most prosperous. Until few centuries ago the whole world was looking up to India for riches and happiness. Alexander the great came to conquer this country if it were not rich. Gory Muhammad and Ghajni Muhammad would not have invaded this country umpteen number of times and plundered its wealth if it were not prosperous. Vasco De Gamma or Columbus would not have dreamt of reaching India if India were not prosperous! Our leaders would have thought what made this country prosperous? What was the unique feature which was there in its thought process instead of totally rejecting India means a bundle of out dated dogmas! The framers of constitution have taken guidance from American constitution, French constitution and British constitution to frame ours. There fore our constitution has looked at the rights of every one and not the responsibilities. Our culture was based on responsibilities and our constitution is based on rights. Therefore unfortunately, what happened is that our constitution and ruling is mismatched with the culture. It is one of my dreams that the day comes and hope that is not far away, that we recreate a society based on responsibility, and show the world that something like that can work.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Naishkarmya Siddhi,</span><br/><br/><span>Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita brings about another extraordinary subtler aspect of activity, which is about naishkarma that state is called as naishkarmya. This is different from Nishkama-Karma, action without desire for fruit. A simple meaning of the word sounds that it is “non-doing”. It sounds very much like non action, but it is different and it is very spiritual.</span><br/><br/><span>He says ‘just by non-action one does not reach the state of non-doing, just as by rejecting the world one does not reach the fullness of satisfaction or one attains the supreme’. He shows a clear difference between non-action and the state of non doing. Action and non-action are two different things as discussed earlier. Let me try to explain them in detail. Action and no action are opposite to one another. Both options are there for us very clearly in all activities. We do an activity or we don’t do an activity, either we take the stance of doing or we can take the stance of non-doing depending upon the need and the situation we are in.</span><br/><span>I put the seed in a prepared bed of soil and give all necessary things like manure, water, and sunshine etc. Now the plant has to go on its journey from out of seed. That is not in our hands. I now sit and wait. Until now I was on the phase of action now I am in the phase of non- action. I can be agitated and restless; I may pace up and down. These are the only kind of activities I can do. About the plant coming out of the seed I have to wait and see but nothing I can do. I have to accept non-action. I cannot pluck the plant out of seed. Nothing I can do about it. I cannot even say, let me reduce the suffering of the plant in coming out of seed by plucking it out of seed. I may on the other hand, damage the plant or kill the plant itself.</span><br/><span>I read the story long time ago whose significance I see now in this context. Some where a social worker saw, a butterfly struggling to come out of its pupa, it is still very tiny and cute but it is going to be a big butterfly when it comes out, but now it is struggling in the pupa to come out. He felt compassionate towards the little one. He felt bad when he saw that the butter-fly is struggling with the hard shell of pupa to break. Now this social worker wanted to help; he thought after all, let me cut the pupa wall little by little without injuring the butter fly, so that he could release a butterfly out of the hard shell.</span><br/><br/><span>His intention was not even bad; it was on other hand very good. His intension was never to hurt the butterfly. His intension was not even to see the butterfly fast and own the butterfly. Don’t find fault with his intentions in any way. When he fully cut open the pupa wall the butterfly is released. Freshly coming out to the world, the butter fly fluttered her wings to dry and make it loose, and she wanted to fly in the open sky.</span><br/><br/><span>Other butterflies also come out of their shelter, come out of their pupa but naturally with out cutting their pupa and they also fluttered their wings free, and in front of his eyes they started flying in the infinite sky and into fresh air. But this butterfly, which he helped, wanted to fly but could not. The person now found out that the butterfly wings are not fully grown. Like the wings of the other butterflies who struggle their way through and who come out of pupa in natural process. The social worker lamented. ‘Oh, god! What happened’? He wanted to help the butterfly he felt the butterfly is struggling its way but unfortunately, if the butterfly gone through the struggle she would have had fully grown strong wings, but because he did not provide the opportunity to the wings , the opportunity to the butterfly to struggle her way she didn’t develop her wings fully.</span><br/><br/><span>Intensions may be good. But a lack of patience wanting to be doer can create a problem.</span><br/><br/><span>He has done something which has caused the suffering and he became the doer because he thought he can reduce the suffering of the butterfly. How can you reduce the suffering of plant coming out of a seed, or the suffering of a butterfly coming out of a pupa?</span><br/><br/><span>Don’t be a player, even in good activity. Some people become players by involving in doing an activity. On the other hand some other people would become players by withdrawing from doing an activity. So in doing an activity or in not doing an activity, in both cases one can become a player and in turn the sufferer.</span><br/><br/><span>Allow ‘doing’ to happen, allow ‘non-doing’ to happen, in both the cases don’t be a player. Human being has a wonderful facility over other creature. Matter has the consciousness which has totally become existence. Matter has nothing but existence. Plants and animals have consciousness, which becomes existence and also the conscious of existence. That’s why plants and animals not only exist but they can work towards existence. Plants send roots in to the ground, through the stones and pebbles to reach the water bed and to get the nutrients. Plants send the leaves in the direction of the sun to support its existence through the process of photosynthesis. The same way animals search their foods. And struggle for existence, because they are conscious of existence.</span><br/><br/><span>Whereas the human being is existence and conscious of existence and in addition to the both, he is conscious of the consciousness for existence.</span><br/><br/><span>That is why he can be a witness of his existence. And he can also be the conscious of his means or effort for existence. But he has an option in this. He can become a totally involved doer, struggling for existence and may be totally absent as an observer or witness. But he can also be totally a person conscious of the effort of existence which is witness. He can identify himself with the one who is struggling and putting effort for existence. And he can also be witness of the one, who is struggling or putting effort for existence. The moment one become witness, one is free form ups and downs, successes and failures and all emotional upsurges behind the player. Then he can witness that the play is going on. Then the doing is happening. This is the state called naishkarmaya, the non doer. Such a person who has realized naishkarma, or who achieved naishkarmya siddhi, he is walking yet not walking; he is talking, yet not talking etc., ‘I am doing’, concept of him is totally dissolved and he is totally one with the witness and which is nothing but ‘I am being’. </span><br/><br/><span>Once you become a sakshi or witness, the search for happiness through the objective possessions, recognitions and all the other things from outside do not make any sense. One finds the happiness within. Search for the happiness outside may be one type of bondage, which is crossed. Subtler than this bondage is the bondage of wanting to be the doer. The doer bondage is much more disturbing and is very difficult to recognize. All the people who do and want to do good are seldom caught in this bondage. That is the reason you see their life becomes very serious and the bliss of life will only be at the lips level. He is constantly in pairs of opposite and he can not accept both success and failure are one and the same. Once this bondage is dropped, he is then free. One who reaches his freedom he is beyond the ultimate pairs of opposite called the birth and death.</span><br/><br/><span>Between birth and death, two aspects are blended. We are working and also we are living. One is the ‘doing aspect’, between the birth and death, heart will be pumping blood, breathing goes on, the nourishment as to take place and the struggle for the existence is continuing. All these things are one aspect of life which is the doing aspect. The doing has the limitation of birth and death. And the doing stops with the death. The stopping of the doing itself is death.</span><br/><br/><span>There is another aspect underlying this doing which is the ‘being’ aspect, the being has been going through all these changes. Yet the being has none of these limitations or the pairs of opposite. It is free. It has no boundaries.</span><br/><br/><span>One who is held by doing is bound by limitations. Therefore fear will be there; where as one, who is identified by being, he is the existence itself. Such a person will not be touch by birth and death success or failure, praise or blame, or finally birth and death. Fear will be there if we want one and we don’t want the other and there is a possibility to get the one which is not our choice. Therefore fear does not touch him who does not have pairs of opposite. That is called as final ‘abhaya’ state or the state of ‘freedom from fear’. This is the subtlest aspect of karma yoga called naishkarmya siddhi. Achieving this in karma yoga is parallel to achieving Samadhi in raja yoga. The description of Brahman is given us “Sat Chit Ananda” where Sat means the existence itself. A person who achieves naishkarmya siddhi has achieved the sat aspect of Brahman and becomes one with Brahman.</span><br/><span>Several ideas are there on Karma Yoga. Let me just give one final message. Yoga does not mean running away from the work. Yoga is holding responsibilities more joyfully and harmoniously. Yoga does not make somebody irresponsible. If it makes anybody irresponsible, it is not yoga.</span><br/><br/><span>Let me now sum up these few ideas of karma yoga:</span><br/><span>Karma yoga can be one of the paths of yoga if only it contributes to the peace of mind and harmony with-in like all other paths of yoga have to give us the peace of mind and harmony.</span><br/><span>‘Doing good actions and guiding us not to do bad actions’ is not purpose of karma yoga. This is at simple moral level. Good and bad is at ordinary level of human transaction. If a human being is not doing good and doing bad he is to be punished. There is no spirituality in this. Arjuna was already good but he needed Bhagavad-Gita. It means that karma yoga is not to give us the clarity about good and bad but to take us beyond.</span><br/><span>So the journey or the sadhana of karma yoga is to rise from good action to the action without expectations of fruits of action, and finally to go to action where the doer is absent and the doer ship is sacrificed and dissolved.</span><br/><span>This is similar to the last three steps in astanga yoga namely dharana dhyana Samadhi. These are sat karma, phalapeksha rahita karma and finally naishkarmya siddhi. Like the body is the temple of god the same way the work we do is also the worship of god. It is our ignorance which makes us to take work as stress or curse or punishment and only if we do some specific activity that will be karma yoga and sacred. An attitude which can make this transformation of all activities we do is karma yoga.</span><br/><span>Thank you so much.</span><br/><br/><br/><span>Question: Could you please repeat the last sentence in Sanskrit?</span><br/><br/><span>I’ll tell you where Krishna thinks about this idea.</span><br/><br/><span>karmany evadhikaras te, ma phalesu kadacana</span><br/><span>ma karma-phala-hetur bhuh, ma te sango ’stv akarmani</span><br/><span>Oh, Arjuna you have the adhikara to do the action but not the fruits for the action. You also do not become the cause for the fruits and don’t be attached to non-action.</span><br/><br/><span>Regarding the origin of this knowledge of yoga, Krishna gives a very philosophical Arjuna. In Bhagavad-Gita Arjuna asks Krishna “Look, you are telling all these things. When did all this knowledge come?” Krishna answers that this knowledge is called as yoga and is ageless. Basically the principles of yoga are given birth to creation. Even when creation had not taken place, the concept of creation, the concept of yoga had always been a part of existence. This is a basic idea. The creation has originated from the concept of harmony. When he created the day, simultaneously the night was created. When the birth was created, at the same time the death was defined. This means that this concept of harmony, which is essentially yoga, was even there before creation has taken place. And at any point of time, if the survival has to continue, then this balance has to be maintained. So that is why this idea of yoga or the state of yoga is something which is always there through time. This is why it is called as ageless. This is something which is there at the background and this is the background for the rhythm that is there. A thing which does not belong to this gets eliminated.</span><br/><span>For example, when man did not have all this technological developments, all this culture and civilization, it was not that he was sitting in a forest meditating. He was living harmoniously. That is his support of life. It is this harmony which maintained him. That is the background of life. In fact, one of the Upanishads uses this statement called “yoga dandha”. It basically means that the central core support is yoga.</span><br/><span>As man has grown he required a method of practice which has to remind him about yoga all the time. That is how these practices evolved. Every one is engaged in these practices as a part of the culture whether he is a servant or a teacher or a trader every one used to practice yoga on a regular basis. The king who was ruling a kingdom of lavishness and luxury is also a student of yoga. Yoga is taught in the school to small children. Yoga is also taught to Arjuna by Krishna in the battlefield. In that sense, yoga is all inclusive. One might wonder what yoga Arjuna was to know in Battle field. Definitely it was not the practice of asanas. But it was definitely yoga. Therefore it is always chanted that it is Bhagavad-Gita and the science of yoga.</span><br/><span>People have taken yoga and tried to use it for their own smaller purposes. For example, the Indian dance has developed on the principles of yoga. Indian cooking has developed on the principles of yoga. People have picked few ideas of yoga although they lack the whole system of management.</span><br/><span>You are asking me a question about new age group and ask me is it yoga. There are a few yoga principles here and there they have picked up and that they started giving several names. One such thing is what is called a new age group. And they say, “What we are saying the same thing yoga also says.” Actually few of them grasped what yoga says. In my opinion, I have no objection about that since you pick up a few principles of yoga and make your life better. It is wonderful.</span><br/><br/><span>QUESTION: You are talking about good and bad, and it is critical in the end deciding what is good and what is bad because it is relative and good and bad changes according to culture. So how will we decide?</span><br/><br/><span>In fact, I can clearly say that culturally what is good for one can be bad for one from the other culture. So this is very local thing to call one thing good or bad according to the culture. They are not absolute. This is essentially respecting the culture. In that sense, there is not good and bad in reality, whereas at a much deeper sense, there is no good and bad. So Krishna also gives in Bhagavad-Gita some simple principles of good and bad. But finally, he gives another definition which is a much more encompassing definition. This is, “That which helps the sustenance is good, that which promotes destruction is bad”. Wherever we can adapt the good and the bad in a society of that society, or culture, or whatever it is, it is fine because that culture has not come to you; you have gone to that culture.</span><br/><span>Take for example the few things in certain parts of India. There are certain things which are good or bad, but the moment you come to Prashanti, there are different goods and bads. So Prashanti has defined good and bad one way. That definition of good and bad in Prashanti is to develop that kind of an environment and an atmosphere which is necessary for people to grow certain things of life. If I go to Prashanti, I can get what Prashanti can offer to me, and adapt to the good and bad of Prashanti. I adapt these things so that I can get the best of Prashanti. If I’m in a car, the moment I sit in the car in the driver’s seat, I have some goods and bads there, some thing right and some thing wrong, and I need to respect, and the moment I respect, then the car will help me. So we should have that flexibility to accept, but they are not absolute. Absolute bad is that where you clearly see that the end point is destruction and if it is going to sustain and not cause destruction then it is good. That definition of good and bad will help us to take world much better way.</span><br/><br/><span>QUESTION: But sometimes destruction can bring something that is good.</span><br/><br/><span>That is right. I mean the destruction and the sustenance in the long run. I destroy a bacterium for life to survive because the badness of the bacteria is that it not only destroys the other, but it also gets destroyed in the process. Let me make it a little clearer. For example, take the case of a bacterium. The bacterium is actually surviving in that person. But in the process it destroys that person and when the person is not there, the bacterium also gets destroyed, too. Whatever that is sustained. What is the badness of cancer? The cancer cell destroys a person who is responsible for its own growth. This is bad because it is self-destructive. This has to be understood from a deeper perspective.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Karma yoga","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2005-02-24T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":187,"uuid":"98a8af4a-9c36-4501-9785-72b03da54cfd","title":"Suryanamaskara - Practice","slug":"suryanamaskara-practice","markdown":"<p><span>One of the readers pointed out since there are several styles of practice of suryanamaskaras why don’t I suggest the technique we adapted in all our contacts.

BREATHING PATTERN Following the breathing pattern is important for the following reasons. The breathing will help make the process of doing the posture easy. Body and Prana have to flow together then only one is in harmony with the other. In sun postures it is taken care of. It is natural that when we bend forward the chest and stomach is compressed and if we do not exhale that will be added burden. Similarly when we bend back breathing in will enhance the bending activity. This cycle is maintained. That is how definitely when we bend forward and down we are breathing out and whenever we bend back breathing in is included. In between the breathing is so managed that when ever we are doing posture we are adapting breathing and not holding the breath.Normally our tendency when we are not aware is to hold the breath when we do some thing. It is necessary to hold breath called ‘Kumbhaka’, when we have to lift heavy weights. But it appears that this habit percolated into other activities. Even when we are bending forward or so also we hold breath, which is not necessary. This continues in almost all activities. Similarly when ever we are anxious we hold the breath. If there is a big unexpected sound around you look in that direction in wondering what it is. That time you watch you will find that while watching you are holding the breath! Logically speaking why we have to hold the breath. There is no reason. But still this sympathetic response we do as a part of our habit. Many times it is not the work which tires us, but the breath holding is many more times taxing for us than the work we do.The practice of proper breathing and the breathing while doing the posture will help us to create a counter habit of maintaining proper breathing wile doing an activity such as bending forward or bending back or twisting.In the sixth position, which is the ‘sa – asta – anga – namaskara – asana our face is directly on the floor or the carpet and our nose is nearer to the ground. If we inhale we may be inhaling dust how ever much we take care. In order to avoid this we hold the breath. This posture also provides us the practice of ‘Kumbhaka’ in a gentle way. All other postures we may breathe or not depending on the amount of time we give in the posture, but in sixth position we need to hold the breath.Fifth and ninth positions are basically relaxing position called sasahankasaka, the crescent moon posture. It is observed that especially in case of patients this posture in between the other flow of postures will help one to relax and regain the balance. Since it is a relaxing posture in this posture do normal breathing.

Though we roughly equate it is not strictly so because Annamaya kosa is not water tight compartment but it is a continuum in body-mind-consciousness complex, which is what we are. Because of this difference there are few things which we need to consider. They are Annamaya kosa as the name indicates it needs food. Food is ‘Anna’ and Annamaya is like ornament made out of gold is called as ‘hiranmaya’ where ‘hiran’ is gold. I will no go into this aspect because I would like to go into the exercise aspect which is directly connected with Suryanamaskara. The other two aspects are exercise and relaxation. Exercise is very important aspect of our life. Exercise involves bending the joints twisting and stretching. So in all the postures make sure that you fully stretch and where ever it provides an opportunity twist fully like in the case of third posture or tenth where we stretch one of the legs forward there is a chance to twist too. Use this opportunity. Regarding stretching in the second posture consciously and slowly stretch in back bending systematically from neck muscles to chest and further on to stomach muscles to waist. So that your posture helps you to fully stretch the front portion of the body. Same way use the third posture to be used for stretching the back fully. Every posture involves some body part being stretched. In every posture also recognize that you one should be stable.If we study the postures closely we can see that starting from the top of the body come to the waist then to the lower portion of the body and come to total prostration in namaskarasana. After that the sequence is to retrace the steps back to standing position which is like unwinding. There is a nice symmetry involved, which is also further enhanced by the breathing pattern adapted in the postures. The stretch is from the upper body muscles to the lower limbs thereby e The stretch is from the upper body muscles to the lower limbs thereby exercising the whole body. That is the reason in several schools they consider Suryanamaskara is a wholesome exercise for our body. When we can not do other practices of asanas due to some external reasons we should be able to do at least six sun-salutations. Yoga postures are different from the physical exercises in several aspects. In case of the physical exercises awareness is not mandatory where as in case of yoga practices or suryanamaskaras we must have the awareness. Another aspect in physical exercises we have to do more and more and achieve more and more which is measure for progress. On the other hand in yogic practices such as Suryanamaskara it should be like a flow of physical postures smoothly and effortlessly and not the doing of ‘more’ is important! We have to relax in the practice which means actually the muscles have as little participation as possible. Therefore the physical exercises are for building muscles where as Suryanamaskara will help us in glandular system and the nervous system. For nervous and glandular problems Suryanamaskara is a good solution. Though they are essentially not focusing on muscles, since there is some participation of muscles the practice of Suryanamaskara will help in loosening the muscle tone. Early morning if we do six rounds of Suryanamaskara followed by brief Shavasana for five minutes we have observed that the day’s activities of the work place flow very smoothly and harmoniously. In hospital ‘Stift Rottal clinic’ at Griesbach in Germany, all my doctor friends do the practice of five to six suryanamaskaras before starting their days work.The great benefits of Suryanamaskara is, it helps in improving the circulation of blood and makes the body flexible and helps to spend the energies of Vasana in a neutral way so that it helps to contribute towards inner peace! Simple muscular pains and discomfort because of our sedentary habits will be removed very effectively and makes our activities normally blissful.According to the energy model explanations when we are not engaged in any activity we can experience the accumulation of some sort of uneasiness, and the desire of wanting to do some thing or the other comes up for all of us sooner or later! This is what we call as ‘boredom’. We actually engage in either drinking cups of coffee or munch some fried stuff or in gossiping. These physical activities help us to spend the restless energy for some period of time. This restless-form-of-energy-disturbance is called as moola Vasana or anaadi avidya. Suryanamaskara offers a very non-injurious form of exercise to get rid of this moola Vasana. Therefore Suryanamaskara practice is spiritual in nature taking us to inner peace and harmony!So let me summarize the points for suryanamaskaras.Suryanamaskaras are good for circulation and helps to start the days work much more harmoniously.It is useful in case of glandular and nervous dysfunctions.It helps to loosen the joints and tones up muscles.Spends the general boredom forces and makes the life enjoyable and the over burden of life can be diffused.Heart patients should exercise caution in doing this practice. A proper Suryanamaskara should help one to go deeper into various aspects transcending the physical identification and let us now try to understand from the pranamaya stand point.According to yogic language of physiology we have these chakras which are located in the middle of the spinal chord and the chakras are supposed to be in dormant way so that the serpent power or our vital force is lying coiled in the foundation chakra called mooladhara. Though lot of these things appear to be rather vague we can experience one thing that is we can feel the laziness in the position which correlates to chakras which will make us lazy and we will be unwilling to take up activity. Once we practice this it will make us active. For the first practice of back bending we have to pull our body from the lower abdominal region which will start working at the mooladhara chakra. The next posture will work on the next higher chakra swadhistana, in this sequence these postures are so designed to activate from lower to higher chakras.The posture immediately after the sa-astanga-namaskarasana [where the participant is lying on face on earth, with forehead on the ground, with chin on the floor which is the symbol of surrender to the divine] the posture which follows is bhujangasana, the cobra pose which is indicating the awakening of kundalini or the coiled serpent power. When the force acts without awakened mind it will lead us astray where as when the activity comes up as activity with awakened mind, the same force will be constructive and all activities become spiritual activities. Therefore the Suryanamaskara has a very deep perspective from yogic physiology point of view.</div>","html":"<div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-113579251279496570\">Let us now come to the physical body called ‘Annamaya Kosa’, which is equivalent to physical body. Though we roughly equate it is not strictly so because Annamaya kosa is not water tight compartment but it is a continuum in body-mind-consciousness complex, which is what we are. Because of this difference there are few things which we need to consider. They are Annamaya kosa as the name indicates it needs food. Food is ‘Anna’ and Annamaya is like ornament made out of gold is called as ‘hiranmaya’ where ‘hiran’ is gold. I will no go into this aspect because I would like to go into the exercise aspect which is directly connected with Suryanamaskara. The other two aspects are exercise and relaxation. Exercise is very important aspect of our life. Exercise involves bending the joints twisting and stretching. So in all the postures make sure that you fully stretch and where ever it provides an opportunity twist fully like in the case of third posture or tenth where we stretch one of the legs forward there is a chance to twist too. Use this opportunity. Regarding stretching in the second posture consciously and slowly stretch in back bending systematically from neck muscles to chest and further on to stomach muscles to waist. So that your posture helps you to fully stretch the front portion of the body. Same way use the third posture to be used for stretching the back fully. Every posture involves some body part being stretched. In every posture also recognize that you one should be stable.If we study the postures closely we can see that starting from the top of the body come to the waist then to the lower portion of the body and come to total prostration in namaskarasana. After that the sequence is to retrace the steps back to standing position which is like unwinding. There is a nice symmetry involved, which is also further enhanced by the breathing pattern adapted in the postures. The stretch is from the upper body muscles to the lower limbs thereby e The stretch is from the upper body muscles to the lower limbs thereby exercising the whole body. That is the reason in several schools they consider Suryanamaskara is a wholesome exercise for our body. When we can not do other practices of asanas due to some external reasons we should be able to do at least six sun-salutations. Yoga postures are different from the physical exercises in several aspects. In case of the physical exercises awareness is not mandatory where as in case of yoga practices or suryanamaskaras we must have the awareness. Another aspect in physical exercises we have to do more and more and achieve more and more which is measure for progress. On the other hand in yogic practices such as Suryanamaskara it should be like a flow of physical postures smoothly and effortlessly and not the doing of ‘more’ is important! We have to relax in the practice which means actually the muscles have as little participation as possible. Therefore the physical exercises are for building muscles where as Suryanamaskara will help us in glandular system and the nervous system. For nervous and glandular problems Suryanamaskara is a good solution. Though they are essentially not focusing on muscles, since there is some participation of muscles the practice of Suryanamaskara will help in loosening the muscle tone. Early morning if we do six rounds of Suryanamaskara followed by brief Shavasana for five minutes we have observed that the day’s activities of the work place flow very smoothly and harmoniously. In hospital ‘Stift Rottal clinic’ at Griesbach in Germany, all my doctor friends do the practice of five to six suryanamaskaras before starting their days work.The great benefits of Suryanamaskara is, it helps in improving the circulation of blood and makes the body flexible and helps to spend the energies of Vasana in a neutral way so that it helps to contribute towards inner peace! Simple muscular pains and discomfort because of our sedentary habits will be removed very effectively and makes our activities normally blissful.According to the energy model explanations when we are not engaged in any activity we can experience the accumulation of some sort of uneasiness, and the desire of wanting to do some thing or the other comes up for all of us sooner or later! This is what we call as ‘boredom’. We actually engage in either drinking cups of coffee or munch some fried stuff or in gossiping. These physical activities help us to spend the restless energy for some period of time. This restless-form-of-energy-disturbance is called as moola Vasana or anaadi avidya. Suryanamaskara offers a very non-injurious form of exercise to get rid of this moola Vasana. Therefore Suryanamaskara practice is spiritual in nature taking us to inner peace and harmony!So let me summarize the points for suryanamaskaras.Suryanamaskaras are good for circulation and helps to start the days work much more harmoniously.It is useful in case of glandular and nervous dysfunctions.It helps to loosen the joints and tones up muscles.Spends the general boredom forces and makes the life enjoyable and the over burden of life can be diffused.Heart patients should exercise caution in doing this practice. A proper Suryanamaskara should help one to go deeper into various aspects transcending the physical identification and let us now try to understand from the pranamaya stand point.According to yogic language of physiology we have these chakras which are located in the middle of the spinal chord and the chakras are supposed to be in dormant way so that the serpent power or our vital force is lying coiled in the foundation chakra called mooladhara. Though lot of these things appear to be rather vague we can experience one thing that is we can feel the laziness in the position which correlates to chakras which will make us lazy and we will be unwilling to take up activity. Once we practice this it will make us active. For the first practice of back bending we have to pull our body from the lower abdominal region which will start working at the mooladhara chakra. The next posture will work on the next higher chakra swadhistana, in this sequence these postures are so designed to activate from lower to higher chakras.The posture immediately after the sa-astanga-namaskarasana [where the participant is lying on face on earth, with forehead on the ground, with chin on the floor which is the symbol of surrender to the divine] the posture which follows is bhujangasana, the cobra pose which is indicating the awakening of kundalini or the coiled serpent power. When the force acts without awakened mind it will lead us astray where as when the activity comes up as activity with awakened mind, the same force will be constructive and all activities become spiritual activities. Therefore the Suryanamaskara has a very deep perspective from yogic physiology point of view.</div>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Annamaya kosha and suryanamaskara","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2005-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2005-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2005-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":189,"uuid":"ac5c2688-9204-490b-a934-135e65775fa1","title":"Surya namaskaras","slug":"surya-namaskaras","markdown":"<p><span>(I)Hiranmayena patrena satyasyapi hitam mukhamTatwam pushan apavrunu satya dharmaya drishtaye</span><br/><span>[He, Sun!,…………]</span><br/><br/><span>[Once I happened to visit the saint Pujya Raghavendra Swamiji of Malladihalli in Karnataka.

In this series I would like to express some of the thoughts about the sun salutations. In the first place sun salutation is a combination of the following practices.</span><br/><br/><span>1. It is a combination of several physical postures starting from standing to go to the ‘posture of salutation’ called ‘sastanga namaskarasana’ [sa=together, asta= eight, anga= limb, namaskar= salutation], and coming back retracing the steps back to the standing position.</span><br/><span>2. The number of postures involved can be flexible. Different schools adapted different styles and the number can be any thing like ten or twelve or eighteen or thirty six.</span><br/><span>3. Before doing the series of postures most of the schools chant a sloka [verse] from the sun prayers or from any of the scriptures like Upanishad which offers prayers to the sun. The sloka given above is taken from the foremost of the Upanishads called ‘ISAVASAYAM’.</span><br/><span>4. After the sloka we chant a mantra or a series of mantras associated with the sun god. There are several names of the sun god which are associated with several aspects of him. Out of them twelve mantras are more popularly chanted.</span><br/><span>5. The mantra will be followed by the actual positions stiti, the starting position being the namaskara mudra.</span><br/><span>6. In every step breathing is associated and the sequence is so designed that it flows freely as we practice.</span><br/><span>7. Generally the practices of Suryanamaskara can be done by normal healthy persons. Only those who have hypertension or heat problems have to consult doctor or any expert yoga master before undertaking these practices.</span><br/><br/><span>Before we proceed further in discussing about Suryanamaskara let us see why sun god has to be prayed. Some developed this idea that the offering of our prayers to the natural elements such as sun wind etc as god was started those primitive days when science was not developed and he would be facing several natural calamities. Since he does not know the reason for the vagaries of the nature the only thing he could do was call these natural forces as gods and thinking that god is unhappy with people for some reasons he alone knows, he was afraid of god and therefore in order to please god they would offer the prayers. Thus the sun-prayers must have started! To day we know that sun is a star and is not a human-form-divine. Thus people go to god out of fear! This may have been true in some cases but in offering sun salutations it is not the fear which has driven man for sun salutations!Earlier in villages when ever they used to have terrific thunders in the night and one could see the bolts from the blue next morning the head of the village would assemble all the people and tell them, ‘last night god has been displeased with some people in this village so he has sent bolts from the blues. So who so ever has done what so ever mistake, please come forward voluntarily, and confess and seek punishment! With that people would come and disclose all the mistakes they have done with that one benefit are that the villages used to have fewer crimes!But in this part of the world people were not offering sun salutations because of fear of god especially sun god! There are references about the details of the sun as a mass of energy in the space as a sphere and as the center of the solar system. Even there are indications about the approximate distance of the sun from earth. Based on all these details they have invented a very sophisticated calendar system. So there is less possibility that they have offered prayers to sun out of fear. If they have practiced sun salutations it is because of the respect born out of love and recognition. In fear when we go to god, god is not important but when we go to god out of love god becomes important and self is dissolved! Therefore sun salutations have a very deep meaning. Though the practice primarily has the surrender out of love which is enriching emotional experience it still has benefit at all personality levels namely physical, mental, intellectual, emotional and finally at spiritual level. Let us look into various aspects considering one by one.For the benefit of those who do not know about the five level personality let me briefly give some explanation. It is a way of understanding human being as given in the Taittariya Upanishad. When we look at a man from outside we only see the outer of physical personality and its functioning which may be considered as life force. One can also feel the existence of mind and intellectual activity appears as if it the part of the mental faculty and further they do not have any idea about the subtler levels. In the Upanishad there is systematic discussion is about the existence at five levels of subtleties.At the grossest level we are the physical personality which is obviously visible. Immediately at the next level it is called the Prana personality or pranamaya kosa. It is the Prana which is responsible for the functioning aspect of the physical body. Eyes see, ears hear and all activities happen because of Prana only. Therefore pranamaya kosa is more fundamental. Deeper than that is Manomaya kosa or mental personality. When the mind is not there eyes do not see or ears do not hear. So we are basically mental personality which takes the support of body and Prana for giving manifestation to its activity. I think of doing first and then I employ the energy called Prana and the body as instruments. But on close observation we see we are the intellect and we identify with intellect much more than any thing and it is the intellect which also makes the mind to think and thereby function. So it is a general impression that the most important aspect of us is the intellect but intellect also sub-serves another important aspect which is our actual nature which is bliss or happiness. We do all activities for the sake of happiness and if there is no happiness we do not do. But only doubt one can have is that the happiness or bliss appear to be coming from the object and how we can say it is our nature. For that Upanishad recommends us to look at the sleep state. In sleep we experience happiness without any exception and without any object support. In fact an object coming from out side in sleep which may be your choicest, we do not want that, because it also disturbs the joy of sleep. So we can infer that in deep sleep state we are touching our own nature which is coming from within which is ‘bliss’. So deep inside we are bliss personality and only all in all other outer layers we have intellect, mind, Prana and body. Yoga has its approach to help us at all these personality levels namely physical, Prana, mental, intellectual, and spiritual or bliss personalities. I shall deal with all these levels systematically but before proceeding further let me give some hints for the practice.Do it in the empty stomachPeople with complaints of hypertension can do this only after fifteen days of practice of various simple breathing and loosening exercises so that the body can take the strain.Persons with back pain should avoid front bending pose. Instead they should go to next posture.Persons with ear problems or tinnitus or seizers should avoid back bending and those with seizers should not take deep breathing.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>(I)Hiranmayena patrena satyasyapi hitam mukhamTatwam pushan apavrunu satya dharmaya drishtaye</span><br/><span>[He, Sun!,…………]</span><br/><br/><span>[Once I happened to visit the saint Pujya Raghavendra Swamiji of Malladihalli in Karnataka.

But it is important to note that Dharma does not belong to anyReligion, just as God does not belong to any Religion. The word Religion isused to indicate the message and method suggested by several great messengersthat was further carried on by his/her followers, the same way that God is the_expression for the higher power behind creation. I am appealing that insteadof using the term Religion, let us call the messages and methods of the greatmasters as Dharma. Instead of limiting the scope of the path as the ‘only’path, let us understand the message of the great masters as one of the severalpaths given by several saints, masters, and prophets. This concept of Dharma will make the world richer; instead of one saint, we can have several saints;instead of one text, we can have several texts. The message can come not onlyfrom past saints, but also from present saints and even those who may come inthe future. With the introduction of the concept of Dharma the spiritual fervorof the human being can be like a flowing river with fresh waters at any pointof time at any place.Let us remove the misconception that Dharma belongs to the Hindu religion. Inthe same way that language does not belong to any one religion, Dharma does notbelong to any one religion. It happens to belong to a language called Sanskrit,but it is a universal term. If there is any equivalent, identical, and allencompassing word like Dharma in any other language then we can just as easilyadapt that word.Now that we understand the broad concept of Dharma and its distinction from anyone religion, it is imperative that it is defined. Dharma has beencomprehensively used for any activity which helps man on an upward journey, asthat is its very definition.</span><br/><br/><span>This leads us to two inherent questions:</span><br/><span>1. Why does mankind need an activity that helps him/her on an upward journey?</span><br/><span>2. What is the meaning of an upward journey and, conversely, a downward journey?</span><br/><br/><span>In order to fully understand the answers to these questions, we must understandthat all creation has consciousness as the basis. Consciousness itself is thefreedom aspect of creation. Based on the consciousness principle, we can dividecreation into three different categories.In the first category, consciousness has become mere existence in matter whichis referred to as ‘jada vastu.’ Matter has only existence. This matter followscertain properties or qualities, which is called the Dharma of that material.The Dharma of water is to wet, the Dharma of fire is to burn. It has no freedomof choice. The fire cannot determine that it will not burn the finger of thechild who put her hand in it. Water at a certain temperature becomes ice and atanother temperature becomes steam. These are the qualities which cannot bechanged. This is the first category of substance which just exists.In the second category, substances are conscious not merely to be in existence,but strives to stay in existence. This second category consists of plants andanimals. They do exist like matter but their strive to exist exhibits a smalldegree of freedom. The moment the seed is placed in suitable soil, the journeycalled life starts for the plant. The plant sends its roots into the soil andsends the stem bearing leaves and foliage into the sky in search of sunlight.The plant has no confusion. That intelligence or consciousness is clearlyavailable. Similarly when the stem of a plant comes out, it is in search ofsunlight. Animals also show similar freedom or intelligence within them. I waswatching the Animal Channel on television one day. The program was showinghundreds of baby turtles hatching from their eggs on an early morning justbefore sunrise. As soon as they come out, they run towards the ocean. I was wondering who taught them to go towards the ocean and where it is? They have absolutely no confusion at all. The researcher who was there lifted one of thebaby turtles and reversed its direction, but the baby turned around and headedstraight for the ocean! They not only have existence inherently, but they areconscious of their existence. From small insects to large hippos, animals andplants try to find food and strive to exist.The third category is the human being. S/he not only has existence, strives tocontinue existing, but can also exercise choice for his/her existence. Forexample, hunger is the way a human knows that s/he has to look for food. But,s/he has the choice to either eat or not eat. S/he has the choice as to what toeat and how to eat it. S/he has all of these multiple choices. This is oneexample of how the aspect connected with survival is extended to the aspect ofchoice. S/he can similarly have choices about what to wear, possess, do forrecreation, etc.This freedom of humans is actually a double edged sword. Having this freedomalone is not sufficient; it has been properly and intelligently utilized. Wehave freedom, but we also have resources. We have the intelligence to pursuewhat we desire, but if we don’t have the wisdom or proper direction then we canput the desire, object, intelligence, and the freedom together and leadourselves into the wrong direction. However, when we lead ourselves in theright direction, we can create lasting happiness and peace for ourselves andothers. Otherwise, it can lead to violence, and ultimately self destruction.This may lead to another doubt. Why would anyone lead themselves in the wrongdirection? How can we imagine that one would lead themselves toself-destruction? This needs a very deep understanding. No one wants to destroyoneself. Inherently, we all want to give joy to ourselves and others. There isnothing wrong with this desire and to find ways to fulfill this desire. Somepeople feel that they are extraordinarily intelligent and are getting happinessquickly and efficiently with little or no effort, but this may just beshortsighted. To illustrate this point, let us look at an episode in the life of the saintpoet, Kalidasa. In this story there is a princess who has built arrogance fromhaving three riches: material wealth, intelligence, and beauty. She wasarrogant about her beauty, her position, and even more so about herintelligence. Thinking that she was smarter than the great scholars of hertime, she would insult them and their work. The scholars wanted to teach her alesson and went to find a good looking, but stupid young man for her to wed. Asthey went to search for this boy, they came across a young man who was sittingon a branch of a tree while cutting that same branch. There were other peoplewho were also cutting the branches of the tree but without sitting on thebranch they were cutting! The scholars found him to be interesting, so theyasked him, “Why are you not cutting the branches the same way the others are?”He replied, “The others are stupid. They don’t know how to be as quick as me.See, the way that I am cutting the branch takes less effort.” He appeared tohave valid reasoning since his weight allowed for the branch to bend and be cutmore efficiently. But the scholars looked at him and thought he was definitelythe stupidest person they have come across. The work will definitely be faster,the effort will be minimal, and it looks like a short cut. But, all these gainsare short-lived. That is the error therein. Man also often thinks of immediate advantages, namely of the nature that willprovide immediate results and results with less effort. He goes after objectsfor his gain but he does not realize that the benefit will be short lived. Infact, very often, in the long run, they are not only giving the requiredbenefit but they are causing so much damage to the system, that even to getback to the normal state, we need the substance. This is called an addiction.All addictions are nothing but where we have stared driving immediate,effortless, or minimal effort results that cause happiness which may often beof greater intensity but even this is short-lived and in the long run, theseaddictions enslave us and ruin us totally.Let us look into a different aspect of humans often following the wrong path. Achild learns by imitating. Children even learn to speak by imitating the lipmovements and sound of an adult. As we continue to grow, this nature ofimitation is inherent in us. Most of the people today are following othersinstead of thinking for themselves. Their only reference for doing anything isthat another person has done so.The majority of the population is merely imitators. They blindly follow what issupposed to be influential and impressive. If those who are influential arecorrupt, who are after short term gains and depend on the material world, thismass population will do the same. However, if the influential person followsthe path of right conduct and right character, the mass will emulate thoseideas and put them into practice. The most convincing example of this nature isthe advent of Buddha, who has influenced so many people to follow histeachings.For that reason, society will have, born into it, a person with uncommon wisdomand experience of something beyond and s/he is impressive and preaches inaccordance with social culture of the time. S/he can take with her/him a largemass population in the right direction not only during his/her existence buteven beyond death. These are the great saints and prophets who are alsooriginal thinkers and have a timeless vision and message for mankind. Theycreate such an impression that people follow their teachings and theirteachings become God’s message. The society which is slipping into short timebenefits and long term misery will be given a big shake up and will follow anew vibrant direction. It is necessary to have such great people with visiontime and again. Let us now put these ideas analyzed thus far together. Human beings have thefreedom to do anything they want, but this freedom is dangerous in itselfbecause it can give one the license to excess in one way or another; namelygood or bad. One is after happiness and this cannot be denied as it is his/hervery nature. One also has an inherent desire to find this happiness by whatevermeans available. The nature of human growth and development has essentiallybeen in the form of imitation of impressive people. If one follows short termgoals, s/he can injure themselves and it can bring about a demonic aspect ofthem to surface. Fortunately, society has several people of wisdom- call themsaints, prophets, or wise persons- who will give them direction for live insuch a way that the divinity present in them comes to manifest within andwithout. Thus, an individual is saved, and thereby, society will be saved, fromdegeneration. This concept does not have the boundaries of religion. This concept does notwork within the boundaries of one particular person. This cannot reach all ofmankind through only one book. I have not asked for belief in this because it is Hindu, or not Hindu. With mybelief in Dharma and Yoga, a few mistakenly identify me as a Hindu fanatic,regardless of the logic or rationale of the statement. But this concept isneither Hindu nor Christian nor Jewish nor Islamic. This concept is beyond allof those boundaries. This is what is called as Dharma and this is the one whichcan replace the narrow concept of religion to allow people to be spiritual.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>There has been much confusion between the concept of Dharma and that ofReligion. But it is important to note that Dharma does not belong to anyReligion, just as God does not belong to any Religion. The word Religion isused to indicate the message and method suggested by several great messengersthat was further carried on by his/her followers, the same way that God is the_expression for the higher power behind creation. I am appealing that insteadof using the term Religion, let us call the messages and methods of the greatmasters as Dharma. Instead of limiting the scope of the path as the ‘only’path, let us understand the message of the great masters as one of the severalpaths given by several saints, masters, and prophets. This concept of Dharma will make the world richer; instead of one saint, we can have several saints;instead of one text, we can have several texts. The message can come not onlyfrom past saints, but also from present saints and even those who may come inthe future. With the introduction of the concept of Dharma the spiritual fervorof the human being can be like a flowing river with fresh waters at any pointof time at any place.Let us remove the misconception that Dharma belongs to the Hindu religion. Inthe same way that language does not belong to any one religion, Dharma does notbelong to any one religion. It happens to belong to a language called Sanskrit,but it is a universal term. If there is any equivalent, identical, and allencompassing word like Dharma in any other language then we can just as easilyadapt that word.Now that we understand the broad concept of Dharma and its distinction from anyone religion, it is imperative that it is defined.

If we have the word religion then it actually means that way so there are and will be fighting going on in this world. Where as dharma says very clearly and inherently that any god or even no god is alright! My idea is not to eliminate religions but to give safe and respectable position to all religions all forms of god and all spiritual texts in the more encompassing word called dharma. Dharma in my sense is not Hindu word, but it is a universal concept, just like god is not a property of one faith or the other, it is universal concept!question: Even though I accept and tolerate all these diversity and the freedom to approach God through any chosen path, is it enough to say that dharma is better than religion or to say that it is the only way to happiness, inner peace, harmony and tranquility and therefore world peace?&quot;Answer: Spiritual journey is the only way to happiness which is uninterrupted because in spiritual journey you are finding happiness from within as your nature and not as one derived from external agency. That inner nature called happiness is the divinity within. Every religion essentially asks us to find the god within and that is the message of dharma too. But unfortunately many religious people state that their religion only gives salvation. Again let me make it clear when dharma includes teachings of several masters from several thousands of years to today, it can easily accept the saints from other lands too!&quot;Question: &quot;You distinguish dharma from religion and I totally agree with you but as one might further find out that the certain ritualistic practices of dharma, coming from the Vedas which have been the source to Hinduism, please correct me if I am wrong, I am afraid might cause one think that while running away from one religion he /she is now being converted into another one. And to say that Yoga is Dharma may cause people to run away from the practice of yoga.&quot;Answer: My point is only to say that every religion with its ideas of the teachings they follow or the practices they follow which do not harm others in the name of religion are all as they are dharma only. In other words to make the point clear I would cite as an example to practice roza, or to offer namaz or doing rituals like fire ceremony of Zoroastrians or the meditation of Hindus are all or the dance of worship of native Americans is all dharma only. But dharma, since it accepts other form of worship and other forms of gods, does not approve killing in the name of religion called jihad, or converting one religion to other by coercion or by bribing!Question: I recently finished reading Introduction to Vedanta by Swami Dayananda and will go over it once again and probably again and again since it is obviously a difficult subject to absorb fully and I feel a strong pull to know more on the SUBJECT (the Self). and to be totally satisfied. I accept everything as it is and have deep love and compassion towards all existence. As an instructor it is my only wish to help people to be healthy, help them have a balanced body and mind, help them find out the silence, the harmony and the peace within themselves. These are the points I have been thinking on and would appreciate to read your comments. Answer: I see you are so pure and you have taken yoga in its right spirit as I see you. My dear Ebru, it is not any flattering but I feel very much connected to you very spiritually. You have taken yoga in its total essence. What you said the inner awareness and increase in that is very true. But many people tend to miss it.Regarding the two aspects of Vedas, the first aspect which talks about the heaven and hell and the practices given are all not verifiable. In fact even the fellow who practices the rituals also does not want to go to heaven right away! He wants to continue here only by hook or crook as long as possible! We have no proof about it. In addition there are also some other practices in the Karma kanda which are essentially for setting proper social order and quality of living like the hygiene and good eating habits etc. With the increase in the knowledge about the world even these practices are out dated and we need to revise. But Jnana kanda the later portion of Vedas are the pursuit of inner nature or gods, going towards peace and freedom from fear are applicable all the times. Yoga belongs to this category. Once we understand yoga to take us inwards then one goes on this journey. Dharma also emphasizes this aspect. Practice of yoga is one part of the practice of dharma, World is never troubled by the people who respect other religions and faiths. On the other hand world feels comfortable and peaceful with people of that nature. It is only those so called spiritual people who do not have tolerance for other people’s faith and god, they converted beautiful age old temples into mosques and age old Buddha statues have been destroyed in the name of religion. In a way they are right because religion gives them the meaning that one prophet one text one god of their choice form is right! That is my concern and I can not give a different meaning to religion because historically religion came with that meaning! So I am appealing to think in the way of dharma and not in the form of religion! When I say dharma I do not mean to become Hindu! I hope I have answered your questions. Please feel free to ask any more doubts.

With the occurrence of many global events in this millennium, religion has actually taken the forefront, globally. “Religion” has become a very important word today, invoking both, a sense of good and evil; fear and curiosity. There has been a significant increase in orthodox religious followers, and an equal increase in the number of people who deny religion. Many have begun studying religion in depth. But is religion dharma? Within Hinduism, Dharma is equated to religion, regardless of its true definition. When people talk about Dharma, meaning religion, they often become reserved because of the conflicts religion created these days. Religion and Dharma have come to mean that we should believe in something without questioning it. This is opposite to science and the scientific way of thinking where we need evidence and proof. So, then the question arises, if we can understand things scientifically, do we really need this Dharma? Can we not lead life without any dharma or religion?In order to answer this question, let us spend some time understanding the word ‘Dharma’ and ‘Religion’ and the historical context in which they were created. The culture that was in India or in the Indian subcontinent (Bharata Khande), according to the archeologists, was formed approximately 8,000-10,000 years ago. The world accepts that the Vedas are the first literary pieces created by humans. The maturity of the people of the Vedas is recognized through this literature. Thus, far before these Vedas were written, the tradition and culture were always apparent in the subcontinent in a fully developed form. As an important part of this tradition, in the Vedas, we find the reference for Dharma several times. That means &lsquo;Dharma&rsquo; as a concept, is as old as the Vedas or pre-Vedic times. By the time the Vedas were written, the concept of Dharma, had already been very much evolved and had become not only the integral part of this culture, but as Swami Vivekananda very beautifully summarized it, ‘has been the nerve current behind this culture throughout the subcontinent.’ Being 10,000 years old, Dharma is a very elaborate subject and it has to be discussed separately as an independent topic. For the present discussion it is sufficient to know that it encompasses the wide variety of things such as faith in God, which is expressed in the form of going to the temples, private/ public ceremonies, etc. These ceremonies are essentially God based. Therefore Dharma naturally emphasizes the faith in god. Dharma also emphasizes the various great people who have guided mankind time and again through the scriptures written. Dharma also explains the nature of things such as to rise in the East is the dharma of the sun, to burn anything it comes across is the dharma or the essential quality of the fire. In that way, Dharma is also defined as the essential quality of nature.Dharma at the social level includes charity, protecting the weak, respecting the elders, selfless service for humanity, and etc. At the individual level, Dharma includes practices such as fasting for some period of time or on certain days of the week, engaging in the right deeds, not coveting others’ work, which does not belong to the individual, non-injury etc. Such moral codes are also prescriptions of Dharma. Thus Dharma encompasses all from the understanding of global nature to the individual level. The concepts of Dharma are so vast. In this culture of Indian sub continent where Dharma has been the basis of the society, people used to live and also even now live harmoniously though their Gods may be different and their practices vary. The people who belong to this subcontinent believe and pay respects to different God forms; there are various temples that they go to, and event the rituals practiced are often varied from house to house. In that way, there is variety in India and within this variety is harmony. This variety has been appreciated by one and all in this culture for several years. Hence, in this culture several Gods flourished, several temples came into existence and at the same temple there are various God forms and a multiple practices. Dharma is flexible and so, the psyche becomes flexible under the concept of DharmaThe concept of Religion has a different historical background and context. It is derived from three major western religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Before then, there was no concept of religion. There were several tribal religions that used to exist in the West prior to these three, but they were small tribal religions. Each tribe had their own faith in God and their own form of God. But these tribes fought consistently, and there was no respite from war. Great thinkers of these cultures felt that they should bring about a uniting concept. Hence, this word and concept of ‘religion’ was formed. The word religion means ‘to reunite.’ So historically, the concept of religion was necessary to see that all the warring sections of the tribal communities were brought together. They were educated and given a peaceful way of living. As a result this concept of religion truly enhanced their peace. So in that sense of religion, these religions have done phenomenal work of bringing the various tribes into one fold. This might have ended wars between the tribes but we are not sure whether annihilating these smaller tribal religions has resulted into overall good or not. The great thinkers of those years felt that with this concept of religion, they can bring peace. With the acceptance of one god and only one prophet or a messenger of god and only one book of wisdom, religion was born. The prophet or the leader of the religion would use power or compassion to bring people or warring tribes under the fold of religion. The messenger has also given greater basic laws of sacrifice, compassion, and self discipline. They not only preached, but these principles were also practiced. Religious institutions thus were formed in order to carry on this message to people far and wide. In order to achieve this, they had political and economic backing. On the other hand, Dharma already existed in the East. There were no such facilities such that people would move from place to place and hence, ideas did not go from place to place. While there were communication barriers, until recently, religion and Dharma were two separate ideas and practices; religion was begin followed in the West and Dharma was being followed in the East. As the world grew smaller with technical and communication advances, the process of translating the activities in different countries and putting it into one language became prominent. Dharma advocates charitable acts of kindness, as does religion. Honesty, love, and compassion are emphasized in Religion, as they are in Dharma. Soon the commonalities between Dharma and Religion led to the interpretation that they are one in the same, and Dharma became known as Religion, and Religion as Dharma. But, in doing so, the important differences of the two were not recognized. Thus, it is important to note that although there are similarities in the two concepts, there are some marked differences. Religion refers to one God, one prophet, and one text, whereas, dharma has several saints, many God forms, and multiple texts. What needs to be appreciated and noticed in Dharma is that it has survived for tens of thousands of years with so many Gods, saints, and texts. Moreover, these are continuously revised and saints continuously come on this earth to guide. The concept of one saint does not clash with the other saint. Without knowing this detail, often people ask those Hindus belonging to Sanatana Dharma, “Which one text is your Bible? Which one saint is your prophet?” Some answer stating that Bhagavad-Gita is our sole spiritual text and that Krishna is our sole prophet. In doing so, Hinduism is not defended but rather offended. Sometimes they feel bullied when people ask the question ‘Look at our religion, we have one saint, we have one god and one book, whereas you do not have one particular thing. There is no consistency’. So this is how the Hindus belonging to the Sanatana Dharma feel defensive. Since under the idea of religion, people have to follow one particular religion, one particular saint and one book of wisdom, obviously the followers wanted to be loyal to their own religion. Under the idea or concept of religion, people started claiming ‘……my god is the only god&hellip;.’, ‘…….my god is better or true god than your god’, ‘…..my book is the message from god….’, ‘……there is only one wise person that is my prophet…’ Thus the religion resulted in war.On the other hand, when according to the faith if we could have accepted a number of saints, a number of texts and a number of gods, then we could not understand why one should say my…is good, and your… is evil! It would not be possible. A religious man started thinking that it is his or her moral responsibility to convert a non-believer into his own religion and may feel it to be his duty. The conversions have become religious activity for them, so called the religious sects. When conversion is the goal, people started converting others by foul means or fair means and conversion has become one the major religious practice for those people who believe in one god, one prophet and one book. The people who had respect and humble for generations towards their ancestors started looking down upon them thinking that they have not reached heaven! This is so because they are so brainwashed. Thus the respect for ancestors has gone away from their hearts who convert themselves from one religion to another. Now after converting their religion, they want to be very loyal to their new religion. So they are the persons who aggressively try to find faults in the parent religion. Religion, and the concept of religion, have created wars, have created conversions and have also resulted in cultural liberation of people. The religion since being the word of wisdom has become a trap for man’s greed, corruption and selfishness. A lot of times they have tried to use the attraction that if you believe in my gods with a touch he can remove you sickness, He can make you healthy. Give the bribe of health, bribe of money and position, or giving some social advantages they try to convert people. If only we spread the concept of Dharma around the globe, we can avoid all these problems. Dharma which can easily accept hundreds of gods can easily accommodate few more gods, which can take wisdom from several hundreds of books of wisdom, can certainly absorb a couple of more spiritual texts. Swami Vivekananda addressed the church congregation in America and stated …“If you hand been a little more patient, we could have easily accepted Jesus Christ as one of our incarnations.” Similarly, when in the culture Dharma, the way of life is so different between individuals; we can smoothly accept another way of life. In addition Dharma prescribes a personal Sadhana. Dharma does not try to lure you saying there is a savior who will save you and you don’t have to do anything. Dharma, though it gives all that freedom at one level, on the other side it reminds a person to grow in the spiritual direction, focusing inwards. The English language is such an adaptable language, that it can easily introduce ‘Dharma’ into its vocabulary. We do not need to adapt ‘Dharma’ to the word ‘Religion’ because that will ultimately dilute its meaning, as it has done thus far. Dharma cannot really remove the religions; Dharma can only absorb the noble and give a facelift to all these religions that already exist and those that come in the future. The new religion coming up does not have to be something like a protest against the previous religion, it can be like an improvement over the previous thought and idea and wisdom so that it can satisfy the changing scenario and moving culture and civilization. This facility we can only give to the world if we can take the world by the word called ‘Dharma’ rather than the word called ‘religion’.We all know that America is a very progressive country which is open to looking forward at various ideas. For example, as North America embraced yoga, the world has also embraced it. Yoga is intended to provide inner peace. Yoga is spreading all over the world like a wildfire. What ever America accepts, the world also accepts. For example, McDonald’s, it started in the U.S., became popular, and is now a worldwide chain. At this juncture when we look closely at what yoga is trying to do; the original idea of yoga is essentially an inward journey, an internal harmony, a peace and tranquility. Once a person develops this inner peace, a harmony or tranquility, such a person can only give peace, harmony or tranquility to the world outside. Yoga is taken as physical exercise, acrobatics or contortions, all over the world. We do not have to worry about it. All that we need to care about is to give the philosophy of yoga which is nothing but the philosophy that is dealt with the Sanatana Dharma or the practices of DharmaDharma is having the components such as the realization of our inner nature, the divinity through the practices of self control in Raja yoga, self sacrifice in Karma yoga, the practices of analysis of happiness analysis of inner freedom and the state of existence which is not wakeful, dream or deep states in Jnana yoga, or by raising above from complaint to tolerance, acceptance appreciation and finally to see divinity through love in Bhakti yoga. Thus yoga is nothing but Dharma. When you look at the principles of any religion for that matter which involve love, compassion, sacrifice, respect for other faiths and practices, etc they are all in a way principles of yoga. If only we can spread the philosophy of yoga as we spread the practice of yoga, we can bring respect for many ideas and thoughts from all the saints and great persons from all over the world.The Upanishad says let noble thoughts come from all directions and this is the approach of Dharma. When this is our highest ideal then it is easy for one who follows dharma to accept the noble ideas coming from all other religions. Simultaneously, when all the people of the world can be convinced about the broad approach of Dharma and understand that what is important are the principles of dharma and not the actual religion, then such an approach will be able to unite the population and help to create the global village – vasudhaika kutumbakam. Such an approach is there in Dharma which is the practical way in which one can practice yoga. This way slowly, when yoga spreads, along with it, the concept of Dharma can spread. A Christian can remain as a Christian practicing yoga and then practicing Dharma. A Jew can remain as a Jew practicing yoga and continue to take the inward journey and the course to Dharma. When there can be such a wonderful harmony between milk and milk, water and water, between the same species, between the same kingdom of plants and animals; in the same way, let there be wonderful harmony between the human beings with the concept of Sanatana Dharma.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Many intellectuals thought that with the advent of science and technology, religion would loose its importance and fade into the background. With the occurrence of many global events in this millennium, religion has actually taken the forefront, globally. “Religion” has become a very important word today, invoking both, a sense of good and evil; fear and curiosity. There has been a significant increase in orthodox religious followers, and an equal increase in the number of people who deny religion. Many have begun studying religion in depth. But is religion dharma? Within Hinduism, Dharma is equated to religion, regardless of its true definition. When people talk about Dharma, meaning religion, they often become reserved because of the conflicts religion created these days. Religion and Dharma have come to mean that we should believe in something without questioning it. This is opposite to science and the scientific way of thinking where we need evidence and proof. So, then the question arises, if we can understand things scientifically, do we really need this Dharma? Can we not lead life without any dharma or religion?In order to answer this question, let us spend some time understanding the word ‘Dharma’ and ‘Religion’ and the historical context in which they were created. The culture that was in India or in the Indian subcontinent (Bharata Khande), according to the archeologists, was formed approximately 8,000-10,000 years ago. The world accepts that the Vedas are the first literary pieces created by humans. The maturity of the people of the Vedas is recognized through this literature. Thus, far before these Vedas were written, the tradition and culture were always apparent in the subcontinent in a fully developed form. As an important part of this tradition, in the Vedas, we find the reference for Dharma several times. That means &lsquo;Dharma&rsquo; as a concept, is as old as the Vedas or pre-Vedic times. By the time the Vedas were written, the concept of Dharma, had already been very much evolved and had become not only the integral part of this culture, but as Swami Vivekananda very beautifully summarized it, ‘has been the nerve current behind this culture throughout the subcontinent.’ Being 10,000 years old, Dharma is a very elaborate subject and it has to be discussed separately as an independent topic.

But Duryodhana taking it to be their weakness rejected that out right on the very face of it. Now the next course available is to weed-out the Adharma unrighteousness by rajasic way or by war. On another occasion Krishna says in Mahabharata to Panadavas. Don’t go for war or don’t invite war. Bur if war comes don’t hesitate to face. That is the dharma of Kshatriya.So it is not the question whether war is good or bad.

But, ultimately, I was fed up with having to constantly use medicine for temporary relief. I wanted to find a way to clear my sinuses and to prevent the congestion without using medicine.One day, I came across a book which stated that yogis would practice a technique called “Neti” which removes all respiratory problems, including blocked nasal passages! Unfortunately, the technique was explained in a crude way and nobody in our small town could guide me in the practice. But my intrigue and hope to find a non-medical cure for my sinuses, motivated me to practice this on my own.Initially, I struggled with the technique. After much practice, I finally mastered the technique and found that my nasal allergies and congestion, which would often lead to wheezing, had totally vanished!It was only after I went to Kanyakumari for my yoga training, I realized it was not “Neti” that I was practicing, as Neti involves the use of a neti pot. I was actually practicing a technique, which used no neti pots, called seetkarma kapalbhati, according to the Gheranda Smhita a Hata yoga text. Outlined is the procedure of the Seetkarma Kapalbhati technique:1.Take a mouthful of normal to lukewarm water.2.Hold the water in your mouth and bend forward, leaning your hands on your knees.3.Inhale fully and push the water in your mouth up close to nasal level by keeping the water on your tongue.4.As the water is close to the nasal passage, breathe out gently and allow the water to flow out along with the air through the nostrils.5.Again, when you have to breathe in, take the tongue down and ensure that the water does not interfere with the air passage. The air coming out of the nostrils pushes out the water and the mucous obstruction the nasal passage.6.Sometimes, all of the mucous is not released in the first try, but the water has loosened the mucous. After a couple of rounds of this technique, blow out of the nostrils, one at a time, so the loosened mucous and remaining water will be forced out, leaving the nasal passage free from congestion.Initially, I regularly practiced this for two months and found immense relief. Now, I just practice this technique on the rare days where I feel a little congested. The wheezing has totally disappeared and I don’t have to subject myself to unnecessary medication! This technique is a little complicated and you may not succeed in one try, but keep attempting, without loosing patience, and you will definitely succeed! Once learned, it is easier than neti and can be incorporated into your morning routine!</span></p>","html":"<p><span>“If I were not a doctor, I would have to spend all of my savings on your nasal drops!” was the constant teasing I received from my dad when I was a student in high school. With my constant nasal allergies, we were fortunate that my dad regularly received free medical samples of nasal drops, so I was able to clear up my sinuses when needed. But, ultimately, I was fed up with having to constantly use medicine for temporary relief. I wanted to find a way to clear my sinuses and to prevent the congestion without using medicine.One day, I came across a book which stated that yogis would practice a technique called “Neti” which removes all respiratory problems, including blocked nasal passages!

When he says, “We do not have the word religion in our culture,” we should be counting that we also do not have the words “yoga” or “dharma” in our culture. Even in our country, we do not have a single definition of religion. Some say, “religion is morality,” and one another makes another comment on it.

The concept and definition of religion is clearly understood by its users as a faith based on the sayings of a person, called a prophet, and in a God that is mentioned there-in. The definitions found within the English dictionaries are aligned with these same principles. However, Sanatana Dharma did not develop in that sense. In Sanatana Dharma there are tenets for morality but it expands beyond these tenets through the Upanisadic literature. You are correct in mentioning that we do not have the words “Yoga” and “Dharma” within the English language. Some cultures do not work with the concept of dharma or yoga, therefore, there is not an equivalent word in the language. Fortunately, the English language is adaptive. Thus, the words “yoga” and “dharma” are now being adapted into the English language to preserve its original meaning.</span><br/><br/><span>2. Therefore, generalizing or to talk in the name of others may be wrong. As we have different religion commentators in our geography, in India also there are different yoga commentators.

When you review the “Is Yoga a Religion?” article, you will note that there is no generalization of anything in my clarification of yoga. Rather, it is a clarification based on the actual translation of ancient yogic texts.

Abstention from religion, yoga, or other paths may be because these persons have heard, seen or experienced something. On behalf of myself, the best thing a teacher can do is to say clearly that “they do it that way, I do it this way.” Why should we carry the faults of some other marginal yogis on our shoulders? But of course, that decision is up to oneself.</span><br/><span>A. I am in total agreement with you, in that, there are several paths and the student should choose his/her own path to meet his/her needs. I am simply clarifying that the concept of yoga comes from ancient texts and that the meaning of it has been accepted by teachers of yoga for many thousands of years. Let us try to understand that there is no need to define it differently.</span><br/><br/><span>4. Is Holiness absolutely out of yoga?A. Holiness comes from “whole” which is the purpose of yoga. “Yujyate” means “joining.” With the practice of yoga, one will be able to be much more holy, than otherwise. Therefore, holiness is not excluded from yoga.5. Isn’t Bhagavat Gita a holy book?</span><br/><span>A. The Bhagavad Gita is a spiritual book, but it is also a very logical and rational text for guiding us beyond the material world.6. Isn’t Krishna a personal Godhead? Frankly speaking, to consult this source and to say “Yoga is not a religion” is a conflict in itself. Or are we only consulting the “not holy parts of” the book?A. As I explained in my article, by labeling Yoga or the Gita as a religion, we are limiting the scope and expansive approach of yoga or Sanatana Dharma. Therefore, we focused on the idea that yoga is Dharma which is a different concept than religion. Yoga is not “religion” as defined by the English language but it does not exclude “holiness” and spirituality. I hope this New Year brings with it an understanding of the concept of Dharma, rather than limiting one’s ability to rise to universal consciousness by the recent concept of “religion.”</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Question:I interestedly read Mr. Raghuram’s essay on “Is Yoga a Religion?”.

We rarely sit still without feeling as though we are wasting time or becoming anxious about the rest of the day. Hence, exhaustion, stress, and stress related disorders are apparent throughout our community. Recent studies indicate that even the common cold can be attributed to stress. Stress induced ailments include hypertension, anxiety, irritability, sleep disorders, diabetes, and back pain. We allow ourselves to take a “break” from our hectic schedules via unconscious methods of relaxation or with the support of external influences, such as drinking, drugs, or social diversions. Unfortunately, when we remove the influence of the external agency, we once again revert back to our original or an even worse state of dissatisfaction. So how do we begin to relax and begin to de-stress on a more permanent level from within?One method, is through the practice of Shavasana. Shavasana is a conscious process of relaxation which is the crown of all postures. It is important to do this after all other asana (physical) practices to derive the full benefits. As it is defined in the sutra of Hata Pradeepika,“Uttanam shavavat bhumau, shayanam tat shavaasanamShavaasanam kshanti haram, chitta visranti kaarakam”Spreading on the even ground in a head up position, is called shavaasana. Shavaasana is good for removing exhaustion and establishing peace of mind.The general principles of Shivassana are outlined in the sutra of Hata Pradeepika, but the actual benefits and internalization of the practice can only occur from experience. The Practice of ShivassanaThe Position:1. Lie down on the even ground (on a soft carpet) on your back.2. Spread your legs and hands comfortably apart3. Ensure that your back rests comfortably.Note: Asthmatics, while in heavy breathing, may feel more comfortable lying on your belly, instead of your back.The Practice:There are three levels of Shivassana:1. Isometric Relaxation (IR): Tighten the entire body from head to toe continuously, while also holding in your breath for as long as possible. Then collapse the entire body, including the breath, at once. While collapsing, you can observe the body slipping into relaxation in the next minute. This is a great experience which can be practiced while sitting anywhere, anytime.2. Quick Relaxation (QR):Another modification is where you collapse the body and observe the breathing at the belly level. The belly should rise on inhalation and drop on exhalation. Completely detach from the body and observe the body sinking with each breath out. Gently chant “Aaaaah” with each breath out. This will take about 2-3 minutes and takes you into deeper relaxation.3. Deep Relaxation (DR):Relax the each body part individually from toes to head. First, relax the joints then move on to each muscle. As you reach the waist, go to deeper relaxation with the help of sound resonance of gently chanting “Aaahh.” As you reach the shoulder level, relax deep into the cell level with the sound of “Uuu.” Relax your head with the sound “Mmmm.” Then relax the entire body with the sound resonance of “AUM.” The entire exercise takes 10-12 minutes.There are further modified techniques that are yoga nidra and progressive relaxation given by different schools of yoga. All of these practices can be done directly before going to bed after a long day of work and can enhance the quality of sleep. Initially, shivaasana can be practiced with audio music but once you begin getting deeper into the relaxation, the music may become a hindrance and silence may be preferred.As you begin the exercise, you may find that you fall asleep in the process of this relaxation. There is nothing wrong with this, but will actually enhance the quality of your sleep! After a few days of practice you will begin to consciously relax without falling asleep. Shivassana assists in transcending the physiological plane and allows us to go into more subtle levels of existence to Pranayama Kosa or subtle personality as we continually practice it. SUMMARY: Shavaasana is a corpse pose which can assist in alleviating stress and stress related issues such as hypertension, back pain, diabetes, and gastric disorders. It can be practiced in 2-10 minutes, but the only way to obtain the benefits is through regular practice.</span><br/><br/><span>Instructional tapes are available at <a>www.vyasa.org</a> or </span><a href=\"http://www.yogabharati.org/\">www.yogabharati.org</a><span>.</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>In the modern, fast-paced society of multitasking, distractions, and responsibilities, stress and exhaustion are inevitable.

Krishna and Arjuna converse within the battlefield where Arjuna is taking the advice of Krishna prior to going into war. It is here that Krishna imparts the following advice to Arjuna:“Yogastah kuru karmani.”Perform the activity in the state of yoga.When Krishna instructs Arjuna, he is well aware that the activity to be performed, is that of fighting a war. If a war can be fought in a yogic way, all other activities must be able to be completed in the same manner!What does it mean to do an activity in a yogic way? It is definitely not combating while trying to keep the body in any yoga position! It must be something completely different. The earlier definitions we explored describe yoga as a technique to calm the mind or a method to develop inner harmony. Theoretically, this is a wonderful ideal to achieve and even fathomable when we are sitting alone without any interactions or activities which can contribute to the disturbances of the mind. However, when we say that yoga is a state of being that we are supposed to embrace at all times throughout our daily activities, even when at war, the concept seems more idealistic than practical. It is easier to conceptualize yoga as a practice we can do many times throughout the day, rather than accepting it as a way of doing all of our activities. This is where the true meaning of yoga is defined: when we are performing specific practices we are doing, but when we truly act in a yogic way, it is our being. Let us further understand the difference between “doing” and “being,” as yoga is more important as a way of life, a way of being, rather than simply a method of doing:Doing is external, while being is internal.Doing can be for a designated period of time, whereas being is always, at all times.Doing may not transform us, but being is a method of transformation, the way a bud becomes a flower.Doing may not percolate in to being, but being influences all of our “doing.”Doing may be useful for an individual, while being is useful for him/herself and those around him/her.Doing is often a cover or mask which does not penetrate deep into the self, while being is a catharsis.By simply performing the “practices” of yoga, one will not be a yogi, or a person in the state of yoga. One must be a yogi from within in order to permeate those qualities in all walks of life.Within the Indian context, this concept is not new. In our childhood, our grandmothers were quick to question a “yogi” in anger, “ What is the use of doing yoga, when he always gets angered and is short-tempered?” It is through such examples, that we understand that whatever practice of yoga one does, is not as effective as having a peaceful and undisturbed existence, the essence of internalizing yoga.Swami Vivekananda beautifully stated, “Each soul is potentially divine and the goal is to manifest the divinity within by controlling the nature, external and internal. This you do either by work, worship, philosophy, and psychic control. One or more or all of these methods and be free.” He further added, “ Temples, rituals, books, dogmas, and doctrines are but secondary details.”The theory is understandable, but it leads us to more practical questions. Why do we do the physical positions or breathing and cleansing exercises in the name of yoga if it is a state of inner harmony? What is its relationship with meditation? How are all these various techniques, from hot yoga to hatha yoga, from kundalini meditation to chakra meditations, interconnected? Why are there so many techniques of yoga and which is correct and incorrect? Why and how yoga helps in addressing health problems? Supposing, we do yoga for health reasons, I am healthy now, so why should I continue to do practices of yoga? The potential divinity as mentioned by Krishna is the state of yoga which does not need to be acquired but is already within us. The key is to remove whatever it is that is obstructing the manifestation of this divinity, or Vritis as referred to by Sage Patanjali. In order to determine the obstacles covering our divinity, how we acquired them, and the level at which they are covering our divinity, we need to understand our true personality. This is further described in the Upanishads and is referred to as Panca Kosa Viveka.</span><br/><br/><span>Love,</span><br/><span>Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>A continuation from the “What is Yoga?” article in the previous newsletter.“Tam Yogam iti manyante stiram indriya dharanam”Controlling all of the senses, including the steadying of the mind, is known as yoga.- UpanishadsKrishna further defines the practice of yoga within the Bagavad Gita, a text of yoga, where he is referred to as a Yogeswara, or master of yoga.

I felt like they are army. I was wondering why should you call the functioning of eyes as seeing, ears hearing, tongue tasting, and stomach digesting, etc why should we call sympathetic nervous system as fighting while we use fighting as a bad thing in outside world. Parasympathetic nervous system now fights with the sympathetic system.</span><br/><span>I am not a student of medicine- do not even have a basic knowledge of anatomy or physiology. But I try to feel from my heart what I come to know.</span><br/><span>Similarly when I was hearing about the theory called survival of fittest of Darwin I had similar feeling of non-acceptability because I always feel nature works in harmony. Nature does not work with an agenda if something is weak, so it should be eliminated because there is no ‘utility of it by its survival’. As if utility is the basis of creation!</span><br/><span>I would like to share some of the ideas in this regard. Not that I am very clear with the entire picture but this appears to be due to the influence of some notions which may be baseless on the theories man creates. The nature has its own way of functioning. We only label it so that we can be guided by our understanding. That influences further our thinking process.</span><br/><span>There are as I see basically two world views. One is that the world is bad and the journey in this world is full of hurdles and we need to be very careful and keep fighting all the time. We need to have this awareness and caution in order to fight and succeed, without which you are no more. We need to struggle all the time. Life is a battle field.</span><br/><span>The second view is that the creation is basically good and is from god and it is his freedom and his choice of ‘one to become many’ that He has become many in the form of various animals and birds trees and rivers sky and the beautiful clouds and all. The manifestation is a beautiful song and the living is a festivity. Every breath you take is a celebration every step you take in walking is a dance. And finally the basis of the creation the divinity hidden in the creation is the harmony which keeps the creation intact.</span><br/><span>I am comfortable with and I feel our scriptures have always taken the later view as spiritual view and that is why we have such prayers samno mitrah sam varunah etc. or saha na vavatu etc. and I was trying to find out what could be the origin of the second view of the nature namely fight is the essence of existence.</span><br/><span>When I think I feel the origin for the first way of thinking has been developed as follows.</span><br/><span>In certain parts of the world, mainly in the west, man had to constantly fight for his survival. He had to fight the nature’s vagaries such as extreme cold conditions and extreme hot conditions when he did not have the facility like what man has today or he did not have the defense system like animals have. But he is having intelligence so that he could develop his skills and technology for his safety. This same argument he brought in all his activities and in explaining every thing he came across in the creation. In order to fight he has to first of all convince himself that it is enemy and it is bad, and given a freedom or if he slackens the whole creation, particularly the animals are there to destroy his very existence.</span><br/><span>But the reality is that the animals do not attack unless they are hungry and they find food in front of them; unless they find that their life is threatened they don’t attack. May be they sense that man is much more capable than them in terms of their intelligence so it looks like they are afraid of man much more than they are for any other creatures. Actually these days so much of research is done in the area of animal behavior. They even say that the animals are not violent just like that. They may just be playful some times.</span><br/><span>I was watching an animal channel. A tiger was lying after having a meal. A deer was grazing at a couple of feet away not noticing the tiger. The tiger just opens his eyes yarns and goes back to sleep. The commentator says that the tigers are not violent. They eat their food.</span><br/><span>Even though such kind of research shows that animals are not basically violent, we have not yet revised our opinion regarding human being who is supposed to have evolved from animal and the human being continues to be violent. Violence is not his basic nature because even the primary assumption that animals are violent appears to be wrong.</span><br/><span>First of all it is assumed that the fighting is or aggression is the essence of creation, and several aspects of creation are explained based on this aspect of aggression. Recently my friend in Germany said that they are taught from the childhood this concept, ‘Homino homini lupus’ which basically means, he explained, man is a wolf for another man. It means man is always waiting for an opportunity how to cheat how to deceive and how to destroy another human being. Wolf is believed to be an animal not only just kills but it is very violent and destroys its pray. In other words man is a pray for another man. This means man is there to destroy the success or existence of the other man. This is mirroring the idea that animals are violent and so is man. Now when you look at how all the other ideas emerge out of it. When you question why man is like a wolf, the answer arbitrarily given I think is, because man is originally a sinner. Therefore the concept that man is a sinner is to justify the original idea that man is wolf of another man. So a strong man subdues a weak man!</span><br/><span>The same theory has been applied to all other creatures as follows. It is not only man but the whole creation is like this. That is why it is hypothesized that a strong animal tries to destroy the survival of the weak animal so the law of creation is ‘survival of the fittest’. To what extent the fight is going on or when it is going on? The answer is it is going on in the creation all the time. Taking the same clue the activity going on in our body is also explained in the same way. In our body we are fighting all the time in the form of the sympathetic nervous system fighting the external aggression. Fighting is a way of life.</span><br/><span>Extending this concept of violence to the work place the work that you do in the office is also psychologically explained as fight. That is why the work place is like a battle field. The whole market is a big company has to eat up the weak company. The big industry has to wipe away he weak industry, which in sophisticated language we call as expansion or merger. Where we can get more for less we are smart and intelligent. It is not only in our own country but in the countries where the labor is cheap go there and exploit them. That is why these days the cry called the out sourcing. Working even at the individual level is like a fight and we need the respite from this fight. That is why we need a vacation from the work. You can see the expression on the faces of the people who go to the work, which it is some thing unwanted, like.</span><br/><span>When the society believed in the theory that every body is a wolf of other, then naturally every one is fighting with the other and every one is looking for his pound of flesh. In such a society what the man required is the simple law of mutual survival. In order to prevent or reduce the exploitation, laws are created, rights are fixed. This is your right and this is his right. Nobody should violate other’s rights. Father has a right mother has a right- child has a right adult has a right. Adults’ rights are much wider so every child wants to become an adult as early as possible. People are given rights and rulers have rights.</span><br/><span>Things like love your neighbor, don’t steal other’s wealth etc were good enough for people to be so called spiritual. So the spiritual laws were mainly the laws of being good and doing good. Therefore the message of being good has been the core message of spirituality.</span><br/><span>On the other hand a society and culture which is totally wedded to the idea that the creation is from god and it is his play and basically man is good and only we need to remind him, these people have a different approach in life. These people worked in trust of other and also trust about the other creatures on the earth. Aggression was not necessary in life. Being good is an ordinary thing!</span><br/><span>The first view point namely that we need to fight and survive there is a very strong ego in it and it has to be nurtured. In order to fight we need ego and stronger the ego greater you are. The character of the ego has been only in the form of violence. It is this ego which says that the whole world is created by god for his enjoyment. He has every right to plunder with this creation!</span><br/><span>One who has no ego can not be considered as successful. Ego is not only of the things what you have, such as beauty or wealth, intelligence or knack, smartness or aggression, these things not only we have to have it but we need to exhibit too, we need to let others know about it. To project it also is very important, to advertise becomes very important. There is not only no value for humility but it is actively condemned. Ego is the achievements of out side and it looks like we depend up on more and more outside because we have less and less inside. We have nothing realized inside so we tend to look out side.</span><br/><span>Showing off the supremacy over other creatures has been recreation and pass time. That is the way the bull fight, WWF or similar things have significance. For a mind which does not see point in this kind of philosophy, these fights look as very barbaric and sinful. One wonders how these things can be enjoyed or why such things are not considered as crime.</span><br/><span>We also meddle with the creation for our advantage. Keeping the chicken in closed cages and putting powerful lights day and night so that they do not sleep and in turn they give more eggs or pushing the animals mercilessly through the slaughter houses can not fit in any stretch of imagination as the leaders of creation which we claim to be!</span><br/><span>This violence has percolated in every aspect. Even yoga is practiced as fighting with the body. All the definition of the asana given by the scriptures and all the definitions of yoga are kept aside because they do not satisfy this basic aspect of violence. So these days even yoga is practiced with no mercy on the body. Even if you have mercy on your body the teacher will not have. There are such quotes ‘no pain no gain’.</span><br/><span>Fasting was suggested as a wonderful spiritual practice by our ancient scriptures. It is not to punish the body or to be violent with the body but essentially to develop the control over the mind which is following the vasana forces. But today even the fasting is like punishing the body and the gentleness is disappearing in the so called spiritual aspirants. Bhakti-way of looking which means looking with love and compassion and having an attitude of pardoning has been replaced by policing and fault-finding.</span><br/><span>True Indian philosophy has nothing in the form of violence. Every thing is to enhance or manifest the harmony or divinity. Our medicine is not to fight the disease but to help health. Practice of asanas is a way of satisfying the body so that body will be peaceful. Satvic or right kind of food is that food that doesn’t leave body fighting with the food. Fasting is also to fight or punish the body. It is a way to give rest to the body or to give such training to the body that body will learn to slowly develop satisfaction with any kind of or no food. It is again and again emphasized that if you develop no aggression inside you will be able to manifest aggression outside also. What is there inside comes out from us and we manifest that quality. That is why this society is never a conqueror yet survived ten thousand years if not more and is still vibrant! It is in this culture where the lord Krishna advises Pandavas, who were extremely good yet, face all kinds of hardships that they should not invite fight or war but when war comes they should not hesitate! Here is the case where even war is used for the sake of peace! This is a culture to please fathers desire son leaves kingdom and goes to the forest, or son gives up marriage including the kingship and serves the kingdom. There are cultures where one after the other son killed his father to occupy the kingdom! That fits very clearly the concept ‘survival of the fittest’.</span><br/><br/><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>First time when I heard that our sympathetic nervous system fights with the enemies on our body I felt uncomfortable.

Two school children sat for a lunch break. One says to the other “ let us pray for the food”. The other says “ I don’t have to pray; my mother makes good food”.</span><br/><span>In the Indian custom basically, before every activity of the family we always have a fire ceremony. When somebody is born or when somebody is dead, we always have a fire and an offering to the fire. By offering to the fire, we offer to the universe. One of the important things that we offer to the fire is “ghee”. The food that we are eating is also one of those fire offerings. This prayer basically goes like this. The person offering is called the Brahman. The hunger inside is also called the Brahman. The fire is also Brahman. The fire also symbolizes our gastric fire. Ghee, the clarified butter is also Brahman. The process of eating food is a kind of fire offering. Let this fire activity ennoble the universe. When we say that everything is Brahman, it means my personal choices do not take part. By eating, I should never bring about the idea whether I like it or not. When everything is Brahman, there can be no such thing as liking or disliking something. I only want this fire to be useful.</span><br/><span>In this whole process we offer this clarified butter. Ghee basically comes from milk. If you put milk on the fire, the fire will die. We make butter normally and then we boil it. Then the ghee comes out. When you put the ghee on the fire, the fire glows. So when you put milk on fire, the fire dies but when you put ghee, it glows. If you don’t put yourselves on this process, the fire dies. I need to go through Yoga practices like this. The Yoga practices are like churning the milk and taking the butter out. Then you put it on top of fire and the ghee comes out. Unless we go through a process of churning and developing ourselves, we will not be useful.</span><br/><span>We usually complain about schools. But when we go to the process of hard work, then the intellectual development takes place. Only then we are useful to the society. If we don’t go through all these strain, we will be useless. So every process of learning is like every process of churning. Most of our prayers are based on reminding ourselves about our purpose of living. Finally we end up saying “om shanti shanti shanti”. The purpose is peace. Peace in the past, peace in the present and peace in the future. Ingredients of our food should also be peaceful.</span><br/><span>When we look at ayurveda it talks about six different taps. Sweet should not be too much or too less. Salt also should not be too much or too less. Generally children tend to prefer some tastes to others. But for a proper eating, we need all these 6 different tastes.</span><br/><span>The prayer says two things. We don’t pray for any favor from the God. We are reminding ourselves about the purpose of our life. Eating should be done in order to ennoble the world. No great work can be done without going through the hard work. </span><br/><span>What if we accept the world as it is?</span><br/><span>No one can be as harmonious as that. How many really can be like that? Show me one person who can do that and I will bow in front of him. The world is not dead. It is constantly changing. It is not dependant on whether I want or I don’t want. The essence of the creation is movement. If I flow this movement, then I will show less resistance. What we can do in a life time? Can I add a little bit of fragrance into this life? Can I add a little bit of positive thinking? Can I add a little bit of taste into life? This should be our aim. Look at the earth. In God’s creation, everything adds something to the earth. A flower is there for a few hours a day, adds a bit of fragrance to the world and then dies. A bird is alive for a few years, it gives wonderful music to the world and then dies. Even a simple earthworm makes something for the world. So everything makes a change in this world and we should be asking what we are doing for this earth. My grandson can ask me:” your grandfather has left a beautiful world for you. What kind of a world are you leaving for me?” You should be able to tell your grand son that you have added a bit of fragrance to this world. Are you leaving him a world of dust, wars, and chaos? Are you leaving him a world that doesn’t have fossil fuels? Are you leaving him a world full of stress and tension? This is the kind of world we will be leaving to our grandsons. We should allow the world to grow, because it is her nature. “Let me add a bit of fragrance to this flow” should be our aim.</span><br/><span>Could you talk about reincarnation?</span><br/><span>Actually life is not connected to death. Death is connected with birth. Whatever that is born must die. You are not guaranteeing anything when you are born, accept the fact that you will die. Birth and death are connected but not life and death. The mistake of having been born can not make you deny your death. What is there in between birth and death is life. Life is between birth and death but who says there is no life after death? We will continue to live in a different way after death. Life is different when we are awake and when we are asleep. Birth and death are events on you. More and more we identify ourselves with something that goes through birth and death, then we think they are absolute. If you are not identified with something that goes through birth and death then you will see the eternity of life. The basic question is “how will I go that state that does not undergo birth and death?” With the practices of Asanas, we are slowly getting detached from the body and rise to higher levels. Similarly with meditation, you get detached from the mind. A flower is here today but it will die tomorrow. But if you look at flowering, it continues. If you hold on to a man, he is here today but not tomorrow. So Yoga raises us from flower to flowering or from man to mankind.</span><br/><span>When we are in touch with Yoga, we are in touch with science. In this process we also have some benefits. These benefits are that we get good sleep, we don’t get asthma, etc. When people come to our center with health problems, I tell them that they are about to touch a permanent science. So you should be grateful that you have diabetes or hypertension because you met with such a science.</span><br/><span>Can we reach the unchangeable?</span><br/><span>We are all trying to go to that state. One of the greatest Yogis, Sharabindu says “Yoga is a constant process of enhancing the growth. It accelerates the growth. What may happen in 100 years happens in 10 years, or what may happen in 10 years, happens in one year. This is what Yoga is. We are all walking on that path”.</span><br/><span>Anybody who wants to do Yoga does not have to do the Asanas or the Pranayamas. There are hundreds of different techniques possible. When mother Therese was helping the poor, she was in fact doing Yoga. What Dalai Lama did was also Yoga. I had an opportunity to spend one day with Dalai Lama. He was one of the really extraordinary people I have ever met. The problems he confronts are unimaginable. Anybody would become mad with the kind of problems that he has. But he is a great saint. At the end of the day I was still waiting for one little phrase saying that the Chinese are bad or evil. But he didn’t have any anger towards anybody. Somebody asked him whether he hated Chinese or not for the problems they made to your public? He smiled and said “one day, they will realize”. You can see the amount of peace he has. All these people are practicing Yoga in their own way. Some of the greatest scientists which we now call the “saints” put these practices together in the form of Yoga. When you practice for a few days, you can follow the change in your mentality.</span><br/><span>If a poor house wife cooks food with love and gratitude to God for she still has hands to cook with, instead of complaining about her poverty, is this also considered as Yoga?</span><br/><span>Anything that takes you to the words “harmony and peace” is Yoga. With the help of Asanas and Pranayamas, I reach a peace of mind. If the activities that I do, add disturbance to my mind, that is not right. Karma Yoga essentially has some principles. The attitude when you do an activity also takes you toward a peace of mind. I may be repeatedly doing the same thing everyday like cooking. After several years, this might be creating trouble for me and I may be getting difficulties. This is where the principles of Karma Yoga should help us. In Bhagavat gita, Krishna says that activity is called Karma and no activity is called A-karma.</span><br/><span>Krishna says that both Karma and A-karma are fine. So doing an activity is fine and not doing an activity is also fine. But he says “don’t do vekarma”. This is where we need to understand the depth. There can only be an activity or a non-activity, so Karma or A-Karma. How can there be a third thing called vekarma? Let us look at an example. I am watching a football game in TV and the child cries. My wife is busy in the kitchen and she tells me to go and take care of the kid. But I am doing an important thing; I am watching the game. So she tells me that the game is not important, but taking care of the child is. Still I refuse and then my wife tells me that she will look at the child, but we will not have lunch. Here, taking care of the child or not taking care of the child are two things that can happen. Both are ok. But when I go and take care of the child because my wife tells me to do, I get angry at her. So when we do or don’t do anything, we should do it with peace. Activity that you do with vengeance is not good. When you do an activity, do it with a smile. But we create a hierarchy on our minds all the time, choosing what is good to do and what is not good to do. If only you can remove that, it would be wonderful. Several years ago we prepared a spiritual retreat with 20 people that would last for 7 days. We hired a cook to cook the food. We were making philosophy discussions. Suddenly we realized that the cook had run away. So somebody had to prepare the food. I volunteered and cooked the food. If I had found cooking inferior to the philosophy discussions, that would cause a problem in me. What you do is your ego, how you do is your spirituality.</span><br/><span>There is no gain if there is no pain but we are not running after pain. Our goal is one thing, and that is peace. Running after pain has a very serious psychological implication. The idea should be not being afraid of the pain. If a person has never felt pain, he would be shocked when he faces it one day.</span><br/><span>I lost my mother. They were very difficult days for me and I was inexperienced. My elders told me to leave it to time. I refused. I refused to sleep and to eat. But then I had to eat and I had to sleep. I saw how quickly the time tunnel flew. I survived because I could stick on to the present moment. Are “staying at the moment” and “being” the same thing?</span><br/><span>Being at the present is all we need.</span><br/><br/><span>When I was young I had a conflict with my parents because I didn’t want to the school they wanted me to go to. I realized that they wanted my happiness but they didn’t ask me how I would be happy. So I questioned myself and realized that this was not my way and so I changed my way. At that age, I was even considering death, and I was only 19. So I changed my school and I went to the sports school instead of engineering school. But in the coming years I decided to make a career in sales. What I realized is that we smile when we are happy. But this should be the other way around. There is no way I can think in negative terms when my lips are facing upwards. I have had many crises in my career. I think one can only be happy when he overcomes the difficulties. So I should be thankful to the ones who have made my life even more difficult. This was my experience. What I want to know is whether people are born equally on that aspect or not.</span><br/><span>There are 3 factors shaping our life. The first one is the genetic factor, the second one is the environment, and the third one is the self afford. A person who continuously blames the genetic factor will never grow. Genetic factor is just to recognize. Someone who takes the best of the environment and progresses is successful. Environment offers us many chances. It is like gambling. Taking the best out of it and growing is the most important. If you don’t give up the personal effort, you will always enjoy your life. It is not a matter of what you have become but a matter of how much you enjoy what you have become.</span><br/><span>When we do the Asanas we are actually stretching the muscles. All these muscle fibers send millions of neuronal signals to the brain. These signals bring about tremendous degrees of inner awareness. Without this, we are aware of millions of things outside. The practice of Asana tries to divert our multidirectional awareness on to a uni-direction. That is why you get more aware of yourself. It is not because the outside is bad. We do Yoga to be able to be aware of our selves. The beauty of experience happens when you get out of it. Let us say we enjoy sleep a lot. The joy of the sleep is your last connection with the body. The body is necessary but it is a tool and you have to get out of it. If you have food you are satisfied and you don’t worry. The body gives you joy by getting out of it. Consciously when you leave the body consciousness, you get joy. This is the basic principle of Karma Yoga. When you do an activity with a total absorption, then you are not aware of the body. Enjoying that total satisfaction is important. When we continue that way, the physical exhaustion shows up later on. If you do a job that you enjoy, that tiredness will not bring about stress or tension. </span><br/><span>Could you advice us some books?</span><br/><span>There are so many books. 10,000 years ago a group of people recorded everything about this culture in 4 texts. They include the activities of life, the cultural factures and the spiritual factors. These four texts are called the Vedas. Based on that, people have made additions and several texts have come. Therefore we have huge amounts of literature. The most essential spiritual knowledge comes from Upanishads. We consider Upanishads as the essence and the others as the supporters of it. So we try to understand everything from the point of Upanishads. Why are the Upanishads so important? Because they work on the most fundamental questions of mankind like “what is I?”, “what is fear?” and” What is death?”</span><br/><span>If you look at Yoga as a philosophy, then it does not interfere with your religious beliefs. If you take it as a religion, then it will create a problem. Then why should we take it as a religion instead of philosophy? In Christianity, the religion was different from philosophy. A great philosopher like Bertrand Russell asks why he is not a Christian. Philosophy and theology are opposite to one another. It is the same in Islam as well. In Indian philosophy, Sankaracharya was a philosopher and also a theologian. Similarly Krishna was a philosopher and a theologian. That is why Hinduism has a unique approach.</span><br/><span>I was working with the patients of eating disorders in California. There was a very successful lawyer but she had eating disorder problems. I talked about Gita to her and gave some ideas. She was thrilled with the idea and she wanted to go. But suddenly she wondered and asked. “You said this is from Gita, and Gita is a Hindu text. But I am a Christian, how can I apply it?” I told her not to worry whether it is a Hindu text, a Christian text or a Buddhist text. “If you find this idea useful, just take it” I said. She asked me whether she needed or not to convert into Hinduism to apply it. I told her it is not like a currency that can be converted. It is basically psychology. After that she came to my meetings with a tape recorder.</span><br/><span>Let us say there is an earthquake here and the whole building collapses. Can you be positive enough to thank God that you are still alive although you have lost one arm? Everything starts with your own positive approach to things. Yoga or Reiki could only be supportive things to clear your mind off. You advice people to have a positive approach to life and to find happiness. Some people make a lot of money in order to convey the knowledge he has to get to that happiness. I observe that people are missing something called “happiness”. All the philosophies, religions, and ideologies are after one thing: peace and happiness. Especially religions promise happiness to people but they give more pain then the happiness they have promised. I believe very much in the existence of one Creator. That Creator has sent the religions suitable for their time, culture and other aspects to answer their needs and to elevate that public to a higher step. The three messiahs, Moses, Christ and Mohammed have conveyed the orders of God to their communities. In fact they only convey one knowledge but since they have come in different times, people regard them as “different” and everybody considers his own religion right, and the others as wrong, or even as enemy. Religion is the most effective type of knowledge affective on beliefs. 95% of the people in the world have a belief or a religion. Although religion promises such happiness, it also causes lots of pain. It is expected to be an authority of belief, but it can not. Philosophy and science can not create a belief. Spiritualism developing at the end of 19th century aimed to prove the existence of God through scientific ways but in the hands of some charlatans, it no longer was a knowledge strong enough to develop beliefs in people. When you look at the tragedy the humankind is in, you see that it is because they are away from an authority of belief although they have beliefs. So there is a gap of belief in human beings. The youngest religion came about 1400 years ago but like all the other religions, it too has been divided into many subgroups. So again Islam too, has become too far away from uniting the people as it has been diversified itself. It has been marginalized. Philosophy, although it gives happiness could not have succeeded to become as effective on people as religion. Religion is a knowledge of God where as philosophy is a knowledge of humankind and that is why people are more stuck to religion. Science on the other hand has no intentions of becoming a religion. Science is based on observations and experience. Today, neither religion nor philosophy or science alone is an authority of belief. On the other hand people require a belief. If God sent messages to human beings 1400 years ago, why wouldn’t He send messages afterwards? Are all His messages finished? Today we need a knowledge to unite the humankind. Studies on this subject like Dr. Moon does, is nothing but a new variation of the existing religions. Today we need such a knowledge that it should be religious, scientific and a product of humankind. Such a knowledge will unite people no matter what their ethnic or cultural backgrounds are and it will be a synthesis of religion, science and philosophy. Such a knowledge should create a conscience belief.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Private Talk - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>&ldquo;Om Brahmarpanam</span><br/><span>Brahmahavih Brahmagnau</span><br/><span>Brahmanahutam</span><br/><span>Brahmaiva tena gantavyam</span><br/><span>Brahmakarma samadhina</span><br/><span>Om Santi, santi, santi&rdquo;</span><br/><br/><span>Translation:</span><br/><span>&ldquo;The oblation is Brahman,</span><br/><span>The clarified butter is Brahman,</span><br/><span>offered by Brahman in the fire of Brahman,</span><br/><span>unto Brahman verily he goes who cognises Brahman alone in his action.&rdquo;</span><br/><span>I would like to tell you something from a session I had in USA. Two school children sat for a lunch break. One says to the other “ let us pray for the food”. The other says “ I don’t have to pray; my mother makes good food”.</span><br/><span>In the Indian custom basically, before every activity of the family we always have a fire ceremony. When somebody is born or when somebody is dead, we always have a fire and an offering to the fire. By offering to the fire, we offer to the universe. One of the important things that we offer to the fire is “ghee”. The food that we are eating is also one of those fire offerings. This prayer basically goes like this. The person offering is called the Brahman. The hunger inside is also called the Brahman. The fire is also Brahman. The fire also symbolizes our gastric fire. Ghee, the clarified butter is also Brahman. The process of eating food is a kind of fire offering. Let this fire activity ennoble the universe. When we say that everything is Brahman, it means my personal choices do not take part. By eating, I should never bring about the idea whether I like it or not. When everything is Brahman, there can be no such thing as liking or disliking something. I only want this fire to be useful.</span><br/><span>In this whole process we offer this clarified butter. Ghee basically comes from milk. If you put milk on the fire, the fire will die. We make butter normally and then we boil it. Then the ghee comes out. When you put the ghee on the fire, the fire glows. So when you put milk on fire, the fire dies but when you put ghee, it glows. If you don’t put yourselves on this process, the fire dies. I need to go through Yoga practices like this. The Yoga practices are like churning the milk and taking the butter out. Then you put it on top of fire and the ghee comes out. Unless we go through a process of churning and developing ourselves, we will not be useful.</span><br/><span>We usually complain about schools. But when we go to the process of hard work, then the intellectual development takes place. Only then we are useful to the society. If we don’t go through all these strain, we will be useless. So every process of learning is like every process of churning. Most of our prayers are based on reminding ourselves about our purpose of living. Finally we end up saying “om shanti shanti shanti”. The purpose is peace. Peace in the past, peace in the present and peace in the future. Ingredients of our food should also be peaceful.</span><br/><span>When we look at ayurveda it talks about six different taps. Sweet should not be too much or too less. Salt also should not be too much or too less. Generally children tend to prefer some tastes to others. But for a proper eating, we need all these 6 different tastes.</span><br/><span>The prayer says two things. We don’t pray for any favor from the God. We are reminding ourselves about the purpose of our life. Eating should be done in order to ennoble the world. No great work can be done without going through the hard work. </span><br/><span>What if we accept the world as it is?</span><br/><span>No one can be as harmonious as that. How many really can be like that? Show me one person who can do that and I will bow in front of him. The world is not dead. It is constantly changing. It is not dependant on whether I want or I don’t want. The essence of the creation is movement. If I flow this movement, then I will show less resistance. What we can do in a life time? Can I add a little bit of fragrance into this life? Can I add a little bit of positive thinking? Can I add a little bit of taste into life? This should be our aim. Look at the earth. In God’s creation, everything adds something to the earth. A flower is there for a few hours a day, adds a bit of fragrance to the world and then dies. A bird is alive for a few years, it gives wonderful music to the world and then dies. Even a simple earthworm makes something for the world. So everything makes a change in this world and we should be asking what we are doing for this earth. My grandson can ask me:” your grandfather has left a beautiful world for you. What kind of a world are you leaving for me?” You should be able to tell your grand son that you have added a bit of fragrance to this world. Are you leaving him a world of dust, wars, and chaos? Are you leaving him a world that doesn’t have fossil fuels? Are you leaving him a world full of stress and tension? This is the kind of world we will be leaving to our grandsons. We should allow the world to grow, because it is her nature. “Let me add a bit of fragrance to this flow” should be our aim.</span><br/><span>Could you talk about reincarnation?</span><br/><span>Actually life is not connected to death. Death is connected with birth. Whatever that is born must die. You are not guaranteeing anything when you are born, accept the fact that you will die. Birth and death are connected but not life and death. The mistake of having been born can not make you deny your death. What is there in between birth and death is life. Life is between birth and death but who says there is no life after death? We will continue to live in a different way after death. Life is different when we are awake and when we are asleep. Birth and death are events on you. More and more we identify ourselves with something that goes through birth and death, then we think they are absolute. If you are not identified with something that goes through birth and death then you will see the eternity of life. The basic question is “how will I go that state that does not undergo birth and death?” With the practices of Asanas, we are slowly getting detached from the body and rise to higher levels. Similarly with meditation, you get detached from the mind. A flower is here today but it will die tomorrow. But if you look at flowering, it continues. If you hold on to a man, he is here today but not tomorrow. So Yoga raises us from flower to flowering or from man to mankind.</span><br/><span>When we are in touch with Yoga, we are in touch with science. In this process we also have some benefits. These benefits are that we get good sleep, we don’t get asthma, etc. When people come to our center with health problems, I tell them that they are about to touch a permanent science. So you should be grateful that you have diabetes or hypertension because you met with such a science.</span><br/><span>Can we reach the unchangeable?</span><br/><span>We are all trying to go to that state. One of the greatest Yogis, Sharabindu says “Yoga is a constant process of enhancing the growth. It accelerates the growth. What may happen in 100 years happens in 10 years, or what may happen in 10 years, happens in one year. This is what Yoga is. We are all walking on that path”.</span><br/><span>Anybody who wants to do Yoga does not have to do the Asanas or the Pranayamas. There are hundreds of different techniques possible. When mother Therese was helping the poor, she was in fact doing Yoga. What Dalai Lama did was also Yoga. I had an opportunity to spend one day with Dalai Lama. He was one of the really extraordinary people I have ever met. The problems he confronts are unimaginable. Anybody would become mad with the kind of problems that he has. But he is a great saint. At the end of the day I was still waiting for one little phrase saying that the Chinese are bad or evil. But he didn’t have any anger towards anybody. Somebody asked him whether he hated Chinese or not for the problems they made to your public? He smiled and said “one day, they will realize”. You can see the amount of peace he has. All these people are practicing Yoga in their own way. Some of the greatest scientists which we now call the “saints” put these practices together in the form of Yoga. When you practice for a few days, you can follow the change in your mentality.</span><br/><span>If a poor house wife cooks food with love and gratitude to God for she still has hands to cook with, instead of complaining about her poverty, is this also considered as Yoga?</span><br/><span>Anything that takes you to the words “harmony and peace” is Yoga.

There can only be an activity or a non-activity, so Karma or A-Karma. How can there be a third thing called vekarma? Let us look at an example.

So she tells me that the game is not important, but taking care of the child is. Still I refuse and then my wife tells me that she will look at the child, but we will not have lunch. Here, taking care of the child or not taking care of the child are two things that can happen. Both are ok. But when I go and take care of the child because my wife tells me to do, I get angry at her. So when we do or don’t do anything, we should do it with peace.

If you are not in harmony, it is because of some outside influence. This harmony and peace is also your health. Health is our nature. From the Yoga literature and the Indian point of view, the word we use for health is “swasta”. In Sanskrit it is called “swa+sta”. Swa means self and sta means being. So health means “I am in myself” and sickness means “I am away from myself”. To be yourself, you do not need any reason. You can understand this very easily. When you ask someone how he is, and he answers he is fine, you don’t ask him why he is fine. That’s because to be fine is our nature. However being sick is away from our nature. Only then we question why he is sick because there should be a reason. May be he has a headache. Headache means being away from our nature. We ask why he has a headache and he answers:” in your company we will get headache”. Sickness should have a reason. Health does not require a reason.</span><br/><span>These days everybody is sick and very few people are really healthy. That is why the number of hospitals and therapists is increasing. Every house is like a medical shop. Why are we away from ourselves? Somehow our life style takes us away from ourselves. If you understand this you can go back to your nature. A technique to go back to our nature is what Yoga is.</span><br/><span>Yoga does not do something. Yoga is getting back home. When you apply the peace and harmony at the body level, that is relaxation. At the prana level, that is slow. At the mind level, it is the calm state of mind. So Yoga is a technique to relax the body, slower the Prana and calm down at the mind level. The technique we apply at the body level to relax is called Asana. Similarly the technique at the Prana level is Pranayama. The technique we apply at the mind level is meditation. At the emotional level we call it Bakthi Yoga. There are many different techniques of Yoga. If you are away from relaxation at the body level, then you are tense. If you are away from slow at the Prana level, you have speed. If you are away from a calm state of mind, these disturbances will be agitations of the mind. When you are sitting quiet your mind is in agitation because you have a problem.</span><br/><span>The question is “how do you say that this is our nature?” One of the important things when you are at yourself is that you feel happy. Smile is our nature. To be happy is our nature. Look at the children, they naturally smile. It is so difficult for us. The photographer has to beg us “please smile”. These days, even when he asks us, we don’t smile. That’s why he forces us to say “cheese” so that it looks like a smile. How unfortunate it is that we have lost our own nature. When we are in our nature, the child is so happy. Naturally, you see that the child is relaxed at the body level. When you let a child sit down, he immediately takes his toe and puts it in his mouth and start sucking. We can not even touch our toes naturally.</span><br/><span>Similarly at the prana level, the child is very slow naturally. And at the mind level, the child is very calm. They are never worried. However we have come away from our nature. Tension is the way we come away from our nature at the body level. With speed we come away from our Prana. And agitation is the way our mind is away. We are constantly worried. If you are not worried, then you worry about why you are not worried. Anything happening in India or America worries us. Even football or basketball can worry us. One day I received a phone call at three o’clock in the morning. At that time of the day you immediately think they are calling from abroad or there is something serious. I opened it and somebody said” Raghuram, I am sorry but I could not sleep and I had to disturb you” He was actually living 2 miles away from us. I asked him why he called me at that time of the night. He said that there was a cricket game going on between India and England and India was losing. He asked me what he should do. I told him to close the TV and go to sleep. Is there something to worry about here? Even the cricket players are not worried but you are. This is how we get away from our nature.</span><br/><span>So Yoga is going back to our nature. All these tensions, speed and agitations are all kinds of “doing”. But when you look at slow, calm, and relax, they are states of “being”, Yoga is a conscious process of going from “doing” to “being”. We are wrongly called as “human beings”. Actually we should be called as “human doings”!!!. Only when you practice yoga you can become a human being. When you understand Yoga like this, it will be easier to apply Yoga for all the sickness problems.</span><br/><span>Headache essentially is not a disease. It is a symptom. Any pain or aching is not a disease but a symptom. When you hold on to the symptom, you can go to the sickness. Understand what the symptom is from. If you try to remove the symptom may be you will miss the sickness. Don’t take the symptoms seriously, but take the sickness seriously. Particularly, a symptom like headache has hundreds of different reasons. What we feel unbearable is only the headache. What is going on behind the symptom may be much more important to address.</span><br/><span>The reason for that can be your nature, your environment, or some other difficulties going on inside. The body, mind and spirit complex is very sensitive. God has created this instrument and it is very delicate. It can not take a little cold or a little heat. It is upset with less food or extra food. We have sensitized it much more. This sensitivity brings about the symptoms. If you closely watch your headache, you will see it has connections with several organs. Your cold or a blunt nose can bring a headache. A virus inside can bring a headache. A urinary infection can bring a headache. A bad stomach can give a headache. Most importantly, a neurological disease can give a headache. Also, a cancer or a growing tumor can give us a headache. That is why a symptom like headache should be understood properly.</span><br/><span>If you have a respiratory problem, then this headache can be removed very easily. If a respiratory disease is causing a headache then you must do every week at least two times Neti or nasal cleaning. In Neti, you basically take the water and pass it through the nostrils. It’s not just cleaning the nostril; it is much more than that. Blockage in the nose happens because your nasal passage is over reactive to the changes happening outside. A small dust, a leaf fallen or humidity cause over reactivity in the nasal passage. People have always been reactive to these things since the old times. What used to happen, is that people were so peaceful inside that although humidity or dust used to cause problems, people were still all right. It also depends on your body resistance level. If it is high enough, you will not have a headache despite the environmental conditions. By Neti, you calm down the nasal passage. When you take the water in your nose, the first feeling is irritation and you want to take it out. Then you close your eyes and relax. If you still continue to take in water, your inner system now relaxes. So by Neti, you bring down this inner stress level. When you do it continuously for a few days, your inner disturbance level comes down and all the things outside will not disturb you any more. We always advice kaphalabati or active breathing to be followed by Neti.</span><br/><span>Particularly if you have problems with pollens, then you can add a few drops of honey in the water you are using. Some people have headaches because they are allergic to milk and dairy products or to domestic animals. In this case, you put 3-4 spoons of milk for one cup of water. There is a device called Netipot and when you put water on one side, it flows from the other. When you do Neti regularly, it also brings an irritation to smoking. So a regular practice of Neti is very useful.</span><br/><span>After Neti, do Kaphalabati which is active breathing out. When you put in water, the water vapor goes to the sinuses and they create a blockage there. The blockage of sinuses can also cause headache. We have a frontal and maxility sinuses. When these sinuses are blocked, then we have a headache. You can feel the headache in these areas. These are actually simple headaches of sinus or allergy. Please make sure that the person does not have any problems of hypertension.</span><br/><span>The second kind of headaches is the tension headaches. In this kind of headache, people complain about not just an ache in one zone but in the whole head. You feel like you want to pull your head out. That exactly is the symptom of tension headache. For tension headaches, alternate nostril breathing is very good. There is a third kind of headaches which also might be due to tension. But essentially the tension is around the neck and the shoulders. These days, this kind of headache is very common because people are very much working with the computers and they have problems in their necks and shoulders. This may cause some cervical problems. When there is tightness in the neck muscle, the head ache occurs. In such cases we apply neck turning exercises. You sit on your knees. Keep the hands by the side of your knees. Bend down to the floor and put your forehand on the floor. Raise your hip upwards and roll your head. When you roll forward, you inhale and when you come back, you exhale. Hypertension patients can also do this but it is particularly for the headaches caused by tension.</span><br/><span>Even if you have spandulosis or gastric problems you still will have a certain degree of headache. If you have some psychological diseases, you can again have tension headaches. If you have hyperthyroid, you should do sarvangasana.</span><br/><span>Q&amp;A Session</span><br/><span>In sarvangasana, do the glands work more or less?</span><br/><span>Actually there is an optimum level that they should be working in. With these practices, the less functioning glands will start functioning better, and the hyperactive glands will slow down. Both sarvangasana and neck-rolling will help to those with hyperthyroid and hypothyroid.</span><br/><span>There is another issue which I should mention to you as you are Yoga teachers. A very important neurological problem is epilepsy. Sometimes epilepsy is due to chemical imbalances in the body. In such cases, they give simple medications. The epilepsy sometimes could be due to some other disease conditions. In that case, it is not epilepsy but a seizure like epilepsy. In such cases, there are medications that can solve the problem. If it is not a chemical imbalance but an electrical imbalance from the brain, that much more serious. Electrical problems in the brain are increased in the presence of oxygen. That is why, patients suffering from epilepsy don’t do exercises that are hyperventilating. People who are epileptic should not practice xxxxxx or kaphalabati. They should also not be doing sarvangasana. This is a real must, they should absolutely not practice these exercises.</span><br/><span>Another important aspect of headaches is migraine. Migraine is a very complex problem. Even thinking about it gives you a brainy feeling inside. You start feeling your brain like sand. The headache starts from the eye brows and goes all the way to the back. There can also be a partial headache of migraine. Migraine headaches can be caused by ear problems also. Another important cause of migraine headaches is premenstrual syndrome. Migraine headache can not be under control if you have a full stomach. The moment you have the symptom, you try to vomit it out. Your uncontrollable excess brain activity may also cause migraine headaches. So do kapalabhati and jalandrabandha. Before jalandrabandha, you may do mulabandha.</span><br/><span>In mulabandha, you hold the rectal muscles tight. Sit straight. Pull the body from the waist. Inhale and exhale through the nostrils 3 times. Then you close your eyes and do the rectal muscles bandha. After that you stabilize without breathing. When you feel like inhaling, release the bandha and then inhale. Don’t inhale without releasing the bandha. This is an absolute precaution. If you inhale while in bandha, there can be a possibility of having a muscle catch. Jalandrabandha is the most important for the migraine headache. Similarly we do the inhales and exhales 3 times. After exhalation, we do mulabandha and press the neck down. The chin should press in this gap. Hold it as long as you can hold your breath. Then release the jalandrabandha and release the mulabandha and inhale. This order is very important, don’t miss this order. The most important precaution is you should not be doing this when in pregnancy. This would be a strain on the kid. People who have epilepsy do not do the initial three times breathing. In fact for epilepsy, bandha is very good.</span><br/><span>For epileptic people, actually Yoga itself is very good except for these three exercises. Other practices will develop a wonderful harmony in the whole body-mind-spirit complex. With that way, epilepsy affect can be reduced. We had a boy who used to have around 15 attacks of epilepsy a day. With medication, his symptoms have come down in 6 years. He doesn’t have epileptic attacks any more and his brain function has improved. For some period of time, he was like mentally retarded child. Now he is slowly picking up all the activities. The first thing that happens in the case of epilepsy is that normally people are not aware when they have a seizure or an attack. With the practice of Yoga, inner awareness, he was able to say when he was going to have an attack. Yoga builds up tremendous amount of inner awareness. Once the awareness is there, they can get prepared for their attacks. The intense of the attack is higher when you fear the attack. This awareness of Yoga also takes away the fear of the attack. Once you have the awareness, you get prepared and you are not afraid of the attack.</span><br/><span>How many times should we be doing the neck-rolling for tension headaches?</span><br/><span>You should do at least 15 times. It also goes for spandulosis. What are the limitations for the hypertension patients?They should not do inverse postures. They should be careful for back-bending postures. Let us talk about gastrointestinal problems now.</span><br/><span>Basically any disorders of the gastrointestinal track, like ulcer, acidity problem, or gas problem are under the category of gastrointestinal disorders. To some extent, irritable bubble syndrome, connected with the psychology a lot, is also one of the gastric problems. In such cases, sun salutation is very good. You can drink a couple of glasses of water and then start doing surya-namaskar. Also, it should be done a little bit fast. It should be like a continuous activity. At least 6 salutations is good. The second one is the pavanamuktasana. It has three different stages to be done. In the first one you do it with the right leg, and then with the left leg. Afterwards you do it with both legs. This is the second most important gesture for the ones with gastrointestinal disorders to do. The third one to be done is arda-matsyandrasana. You sit and twist the body in that. This you can do repeatedly on either side. After this, you can go to bhujangasana. We repeat bhujangasana 5-6 times. Afterwards you walk front and back on your toes. You stretch your hands upwards, pull the body up, stand on the toes and walk front and back. You walk about 15-20 steps 3-4 times. Then you do savasana. People with hypertension or epilepsy can do these practices. Even when you are pregnant you can do these. Can you give us some advices for people with memory problem?Trataka is very good for memory. Just keep a flame at 4-6 feet distance and keep looking at it. Watch it with plain eyes. Just fix your eyes on the flame with your eyes and your mind. Constantly keep looking at the flame. Have a smile on your face. Your breath should be normal. Your whole attention should be on the flame. Keep doing this for about 3 minutes. Then close your eyes and relax for 1 minute. Then open your eyes for once again. Continue to look at the flame for about another 3 minutes. After that turn your head to the right and then to the left. But continue to be looking at the flame as you do this. Again close your eyes for a minute. Open your eyes and continue to look at it for 2-3minutes. This time turn your head up and down slowly. Do this for regularly every day and it will improve your memory. It normally takes 10-15 minutes. Kaphalabati and Nadishudi also improve the memory.</span><br/><span>You had better do the Trataka in a dark place. Behind the flame, there should not be anything to disturb your mind.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Raghuramji - President of 1st Yoga Festival - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>It normally takes more than a week to cover the techniques regarding headaches, migraine or the gastrointestinal diseases. Here we have around 1.5 hours and let us try to make best use of it.</span><br/><span>I will not go into the details of anatomy or psychology because that is a different subject by itself. I will give you their connections with Yoga. When Yoga was developed those people did not have the anatomy knowledge we have today. We should not also forget that they understood human physiology by looking in the words rather than the laboratories. If a Yogi can look inside and feel what the things inside that are effecting are, we also can do it. Lots of Yogic knowledge is achieved by looking in words. If you say you have a mind, you don’t say it because the books tell you, you say it by experience.</span><br/><span>Let us try to understand things from Yoga point of view, looking inside.

Do this for regularly every day and it will improve your memory. It normally takes 10-15 minutes. Kaphalabati and Nadishudi also improve the memory.</span><br/><span>You had better do the Trataka in a dark place.

Many times, even in your sleep or when you are sitting very freely and relaxed, your mind gets into meditation without your knowledge. You sometimes cross that barrier of time, suddenly you are in a different time and then you get confused. You get up but you have the impressions of what you have seen. It might be about the future. Currently it doesn’t make sense but when the time gets there, you suddenly say “I know it”. You had seen it one month ago but it didn’t make any sense at that time. If the mind was aware of the past, present and the future, then the mind would get mad. Things would be confused, and you would get disturbed. That’s why it is a safety mechanism that our mind works in. In a mental person, the past, present and the future are all together and he gets confused and becomes a mental patient. It is fortunate that we have our perception of now, not the future. When all the possibilities get in your mind, you become schizophrenic.</span><br/><span>You see the mirage. The mirage is not real, but seeing the mirage is real. Even a person who knows the signs behind the mirage and knows that it cannot exist, continues to see the mirage.</span><br/><span>Do the Yogis who have supernatural powers know that the world is not real? Is this why they can do such things?</span><br/><span>The physical reality follows certain laws. I can only create an illusion that I am flying. I can cerate an illusion and you will all think that I am flying. So it is rather a hypnosis rather than Yoga. I can hypnotize you in such a way that you will think I am flying in the air. God first created the laws, and then the laws became the objects. Burning comes first, and then it becomes fire. If a Yogi denies the fire burning, that means he is denying God. You can not deny the God’s laws. The creation is based on laws.</span><br/><span>Are the paranormal powers also an illusion?</span><br/><span>It says in Bhagavat Gita that if I have a desire to do something, then the good powers help me to improve my activity. Many times, such things appear to be happening out of nowhere. Let me give an example. One time, I wanted to go to Romania. Romanian Embassy rejected my Visa. I was already in Germany then. There was a great desire from the people there that I should go to Romania. Then somehow Romanian Embassy in Germany calls me and tells me that they will give me Visa. But it was too late, and didn’t have time to go and get the Visa. They told me to come and get my Visa even if it is midnight. So I got my Visa at 23:00. How did this happen? In fact it was a miracle. The taught of me willing to go and do some good things over there made this happen. This willingness goes to their minds and then they go ahead and do it. </span><br/><span>Is this kind of like hypnosis?</span><br/><span>No it is not very much like hypnosis. These vibrations are already there, you are just catching them. </span><br/><span>In Karma principle, it is said that if you think everything positively, then good things will happen. If everything is there already, just by positive thinking, you can pick the good ones for yourself. </span><br/><span>The people who take drugs know where they can get drugs in a city first time they get there. They immediately pick up the vibrations and they interact. If you have a good heart, people with good heart will come to you, almost like accidental. Actually it is because the good vibes are attracting the good vibes of the other. </span><br/><span>But even if you have a good heart, if the other person doesn’t have that good vibes, then there is no way you can change her. There are even husbands and wives like this.</span><br/><span>Then they quarrel and get separated afterwards. If you and I are thinking in different ways, we can be together for some time but after that we separate. There is no need to match 100%. The important aspects’ matching is enough to spend a life time with that person. We might be matching with somebody else in different aspects. A wife might be matching spiritually with somebody else. </span><br/><span>Doesn’t that bring competition? </span><br/><span>You should not feel that it is a competition. You should feel that it is what you need. If you think of it this way, then you never feel competition.</span><br/><span>There are so many girls close to me. They are married but their husbands do not worry that my presence in the women’s lives is going to affect their presence in their wives’ lives.</span><br/><span>What is the difference between the schizophrenic people and us? May be we are all dreaming. How can we be sure that this world is real? There is a book of Swami Krishnananda in which he says that this world is a dream. His student asks him that the world look so real and how it could be unreal. He answers: “when you are dreaming, you never know that you are dreaming. Only after waking up, you can say that you are dreaming”. This is the analogy he was making.</span><br/><span>We should understand one thing. For a person who is dreaming, the dream is very real. When he wakes up, a consciousness looks at the dream and says that it was a dream. The inside consciousness in a dream, also becomes dream. When I look from the wakeful consciousness, my dream consciousness becomes a dream itself. Then the whole world becomes unreal. When I rise from the world consciousness to soul, then this world becomes unreal. But before that, my being in this world becomes unreal. It is not right if I consider myself real, but the world I live in unreal. We know that what we lived was a dream because we have experienced another consciousness other than the dream consciousness. Only when you are in the awake consciousness can you tell that the dream was unreal. So you have to identify yourself as out of the dream consciousness to be able to do that. </span><br/><span>When you meditate, you realize that this world is not real. But afterwards you go ahead and continue to live in this world. That means that you don’t have to reject your dream consciousness. You still know that there is a dream. </span><br/><span>I know that I had a dream last night, but again I will go back to a dream tonight. It is like this, I will once again feel that the dream is real. Nobody can be free from the dream. You see the rainbow and you know that there is no such thing as a rainbow. But still you continue to see it. It is just like the mirage example. The knowledge does not take you away from the experience. You will not be influenced by that. Your consciousness that is out of the event will be influenced but not your dream consciousness. So your wakeful consciousness will not be influenced by the dream. But the dream consciousness will be influenced by the dream. It depends on what you identify yourself with most of the time. I try to identify myself with not this consciousness. What is the difference between this consciousness and the other consciousness which is supposed to be my soul? How much I am not attached with this, gives me that consciousness. If you can not get detached, then you can never experience that consciousness. </span><br/><span>Is it possible to be detached without being Tamasic? There is a very slight difference between detachment and being ignorant. You can not be detached from just something.</span><br/><span>Care comes from loving. I love you so I care for you. So my care comes from my love much more than my attachment. My attachment makes me say:” I am important and therefore the world is important”. If I have an attachment with you and I need you all the time for my sake, it is not the attachment that cares for you. I do not care about the world if I have an attachment. If I love you then I should care for you because of you. If I tell you not to go to work because I want you with me, this is adjustment. I f I love you, you should be free to do however you want. So love cares much more than the attachment. Attachment actually is opposite of love. This is a very common mistake that we feel love and attachment are together. If I really love you, then I should have no attachment with you. </span><br/><span>It is also about trust.</span><br/><span>Yes, it is. We have a Sanskrit word called “Shraddha”. It means much more than just trust and faith. If I trust that you will do something, and you don’t do it a couple of times, then I distrust you. Trust and distrusts depends on the events outside. Shraddha does not depend on the events outside. My importance that I give to the world is Shraddha. If you have a Shraddha, then no damage can come to you. If you have Shraddha, you can put it on me or on an activity that you do. You may lose your faith in men, but just because of one person, you don’t lose faith in mankind. You can not live alone, so you have to have faith in people.</span><br/><span>This is also what Krishna says in Gita.</span><br/><span>Yes. Shraddha means basically, “yes, I am open”. So it means that if you offer me tea, I will open my cup and take it. So Shraddha means “I am ready to take”. It is like opening the windows for the sun to come in, but the sun is already there. There are two differences between faith and Shraddha. Faith basically is blind. In faith, the intellect is incapable of taking it. With Shraddha, intellect comes. The moment intellect comes, if I don’t have Shraddha, then it becomes negative. If you have Shraddha, you don’t add motive behind it but at the same time, I will judge with my intellect. Upanishad says:” how do you approach a teacher?” The answer is: “Don’t approach with faith because it is blind. Approach him with Shraddha.” It means that you can re-question whatever the teacher says. You should question it seriously, not negatively. Let me give an example. Shamivaran had a doctor friend called Dr. Clark from Harvard. There were two doctors very close to him; one was Dr. Clark and the other was Dr. Ballentine. I was with those doctors once. A heart patient came. Shamivaran told him to do some things. Ballentine said that doing another test for the patient would be better. But Dr. Clark refused, saying “Shamivaran told us to do only this one”. I asked why they couldn’t critique Shamivaran. He was not even a medical person. They told me that they had faith in Shamivaran. This is wrong. Faith does not mean that you give up your intellect. In faith, you give up intellect but in Shraddha, you don’t. Let us say you are not a medical person at all and you go to a doctor. When the doctor says something, your intellect will not help you there. You have faith in the doctor because you know he has solved similar cases before, or you know somebody whom he has cured before. So you don’t question his diagnosis. For faith, you need a track record of faith. For Shraddha, you need an intellect and an approach. People should come to me with Shraddha, not with faith because I want you to be total. Shraddha means “giving totally” but faith means” I am taking away the intellect I am giving you”. So in faith, you don’t give totally. If somebody tells me he is listening to me with faith, then I could as well have a bug listen to me because bugs don’t have intellects. I want a human being to follow me not a bug. I want an intellect and an emotion to come with my listeners. Shraddha has totality in the picture; the intellect is not kept aside like faith does. If I go the airport and they tell me that everything is all right with my ticket. Then I have a faith that I will fly tomorrow. We need faith in this world to work because the world is co complicated that you can not go into all the details yourself.</span><br/><span>If the God is the creator and he is the forgiver, what is the difference between these two ways of doing something or not doing anything?</span><br/><span>Anything is ok, provided you don’t have ego behind it. If a person is rajasic, he will be forced to things, or if he is satiric, he will work like the way you water a plant. It doesn’t matter which way you do things. If your way is rajasic, you can only be happy by forcing, if your nature is satiric you are uncomfortable with force. </span><br/><span>In case I don’t come back to life again, what will happen to me and my soul?</span><br/><span>Should something be happening? You become yourself and nothing else. You become one.</span><br/><span>Does this mean “becoming God?”</span><br/><span>The language of becoming is the language of the world. Being is not the same as becoming. </span><br/><span>What does it feel like to become one?</span><br/><span>Don’t worry about that. </span><br/><span>If there is a being, then there should also be a non-being.</span><br/><span>Our minds are full of “yes” and “no”, and “right” and “wrong”. That is why we have all these questions. </span><br/><span>Should we be asking for things, for them to happen? </span><br/><span>It is not just a matter of asking. It means you are seeking, and looking for it. You have an urge to know. It is like opening the windows for the sun to come in. If you don’t open the windows, then the sun will not come. So, there, asking doesn’t mean having questions. The moment you say you know something, you will not know any more. But if you say you don’t know, then you are open and you are seeking. Some people come to my seminars for some spiritual journey but if they don’t ask, they can not make any improvement.</span><br/><span>Some people were born in Prashanti, then how do they change?</span><br/><span>There are three things responsible for a growth. First one is our Karma, and the second one is the environment. The third one is our own effort.</span><br/><span>Why did they give up?</span><br/><span>They give up because after they were born, they get attracted by the environment that is non- spiritual. They find happiness there. If you want to go to Himalayas, you work hard to get there. Then suddenly you come to a milestone that says Himalayas is 88 km away. Then you get happy only with that and stay there. </span><br/><span>When I had a relationship, I realized afterwards that I had to allocate the time of Yoga to my partner. This could happen to anyone and it is a bit scary. If I were born in Prashanti then it would be easier. You can very easily get attracted to something but in Pradhanti it should not be that way. </span><br/><span>In Prashanti, once you get used to that routine, then you will be looking for what you are missing. That is why we need “satsang”. Prashanti can offer satsang. It is not something you should do compulsorily, you should do it voluntarily. People all over the world like my lectures and they come and listen to me. But how many of them are in Prashanti? If the personal commitment is there, then the process goes on. </span><br/><span>If you see what is there in front of you and take the right step to go ahead, it is not fatalistic. If you go to sleep thinking God will take care of everything, this is fatalistic. When you do everything that needs to be done, only then you can leave things to God. I can not go on eating junk food, and say that God will take care of it and I will not become obese. This is fatalistic. I should be taking the right food and make my exercises. In case I get a cancer only then I can surrender to God. Surrendering to God does not exclude your efforts. </span><br/><span>My Reiki teacher told me that if you want something from God, I should ask from God, and then wait for the answer instead of praying. </span><br/><span>We don’t ask God anything for ourselves. If you ask something from God, it means you are separating yourself from divinity. My hand does not ask for anything from me, because my hand is a part of me. I am a part of God, how can I ask for anything from Him? What unites us together is love. So we just go to God out of love. He is just wonderful and he is me. Only with love can we two become one. We should be praying for the mankind. We should pray for everybody to be healthy, not just us. </span><br/><span>It is said that some of the Gods can never be like the saints and the saints are higher beings than the Gods. How is this possible?</span><br/><span>These Gods have certain types of duties they are responsible of. Total internal freedom is much more superior to doing chores. Indra is basically a position. If you can deny even that position and go ahead, then you are a greater saint. Indra has given up his Indra state like a president who gives up his title. You can become so free that you can forget all about your layers. Human beings are superior because they can improve themselves. All the celestial artists are small Gods. A Guru is not just a Brahma but he is a person from high levels. </span><br/><span>Are the angels in Islam, Christianity, or any other religion like Gods in the Hindu system? </span><br/><span>In Indian philosophy that is why we have several levels of Gods which could be called as angels. These are abstract details. It is not really worthwhile to be spending much time on that. It is much more important to work on how we can free and grow ourselves. </span><br/><span>You said we should be praying for the mankind. I pray for my realization.</span><br/><span>Praying for the realization of oneself and working for the realization are not opposite to each other. It is not a bad thing to ask for realization of oneself. You surrender your ego in the form of prayer but you still continue to work. If you don’t work then you become tamastic. So it is good and necessary that we pray God for realization and nothing else. The moment I think of something else apart from realization, I separate myself out of God. </span><br/><span>The idea of Neti Neti, not his or not that, is a tool. I do not say Neti Neti for things that I do not have any connection with. I am not a Prime Minister, why should I worry about it? If you hold on to Neti Neti alone, than it leads you to negativity. It is kind of desperate. It leads you to a state of depression. Neti Neti does not have the freedom. </span><br/><span>Why would you be depressed then?</span><br/><span>You are still thinking of being somebody but you are constantly becoming nobody. Neti Neti is even worse than a failure. A failure is all right, and can be improved. But if you are not even a failure it means you are so bad. Many people don’t even attend anything because they don’t want to be a failure. Then they can’t be a success. In the process of Neti Neti you may be becoming depressed inside. It is like walking on a robe. </span><br/><span>What is the purpose of Yoga?</span><br/><span>Actually the purpose of life is very important. </span><br/><span>Then what is the purpose of life?</span><br/><span>The purpose of life is living. We constantly struggle to live, rather than living. We don’t appreciate the moment we are living. Yoga is essentially makes you feel that you are living. </span><br/><span>So the aim of Yoga is to keep me living. How is this possible? Is it with these postures or with philosophy?</span><br/><span>It is basically with philosophy that is translated into practical ways through asanas, pranayamas, etc. </span><br/><span>When we do all these asanas, does it make us live? I am not into Yoga, so what I do is struggle for living, but since you are into Yoga, you are living. Is that so? </span><br/><span>We should remove from our minds that Yoga is just doing breath exercises and some postures. They are only applications of Yoga. Yoga includes much more than that. We should be doing activities according to Yoga. This means that if you are doing an activity, you should be 100% in that activity. If I am talking, my mind, my brain and my mouth are all focusing on my talking. If I am thoroughly behind this activity that means I am living that activity. A person may not do the asanas or the pranayamas but he may be a Yogi by doing an activity in such a way. A person doing all the exercises but complaining all the time when eating is not a Yogi. </span><br/><span>I was told before that the purpose of Yogi was to prevent ourselves from being reincarnated several times and unite with the One immediately. </span><br/><span>It is not a question of being reincarnated. Without this experience people will have their own agendas, difficulties, desires, angers, etc. That causes coming back to life again. Then the world, even before you were born, is already bonded with certain agendas. The birth of a person, who has practiced Yoga and is free, will not be out of bondage but out of freedom. Such a person’s only activity will be helping others and enjoy being. Those people that we call as the saints or the prophets are such people who are in this world only for helping others. So it is not freedom from birth but freedom in birth. </span><br/><span>What do you exactly mean by freedom? What are we free of? Am I not free?</span><br/><span>For me, everybody has freedom. We also have limited purposes. A person who knows it can apply them right away. For example, something really upsetting you has happened. You may apply freedom and not worry about it. There must be degrees to applying freedom. That freedom gives us a big relief. Otherwise we would have been crushed by the life experiences. A broken heart can kill a person but we can overcome it and not worry about it. This realization, with the help of Yoga, helps us to apply freedom all the time. </span><br/><span>So you are talking about not caring.</span><br/><span>Such a person cares more consciously because he knows he has freedom inside. </span><br/><span>Let us say there is something going wrong with my job but I didn’t give much importance to it and I didn’t worry about it. A very close friend of mine has got cancer but I still didn’t worry about it. Somebody crushed my car and I didn’t worry about that either. Is this what you are mean by freedom?</span><br/><span>Let me give you an example. Two years ago I was supposed to travel to USA. There was no problem about my visas, passports, etc. Everything was ready months ago. I went to Bombay airports 3 hours ago for the check in. When I went there I realized that there was a big crowd there and a big commotion was going on. I asked what had happened. They said that the plane was already booked and they were not going to take any more seats. I told them that I had a ticket and a reserved seat. They told me that all the other men had the same things and that is why they are fighting. I could also fight or get angry and shout. But because of my peaceful calm nature, I enquired why this mistake had happened. They told me that normally 20% of the tickets were cancelled and that is why they had oversold the tickets. Legally they were all right. I asked them what the alternative for me could be. They told me I could fly tomorrow and they would pay me for all the extra expenses. I thought and came to the idea that I was not going to lose anything by going one day late. I could understand that person’s difficulty and I felt compassionate for him. I could fight with him and spoil both his mind and my mind. However I accepted his offer and told him to fix me a room from a hotel. The man was shocked. He couldn’t believe that I had said ok and not fight with him. I talked with the other passengers who were fighting and tried to convince them into my solution. I convinced a few passengers and in 10 minutes, all the commotion was gone. Because of my peaceful nature and compassion for people, I could go on positively. Let me give you the philosophical background behind it. Brahman and the Atman are the total peaceful states. Immediately next to them comes love, compassion and sense of wonder as manifestations. We call these three things “beauty”. When we limit these with ego, then comes the other feelings like hate. When we give up ego, love, compassion and sense of wonder will come up to the surface. That is why all the prophets manifested nothing but pure love, compassion and sense of wonder. Yoga helps us do this.</span><br/><span>Why have the human beings been created?</span><br/><span>The material world has the cause and the effect. We always look for a reason. There is always a purpose and an act behind it. But the divine does not work with the equation of cause and affect. So such a question, when you look from a spiritual point of view, is because of God’s freedom to create human beings. In Sanskrit way, we can say the God has become human beings. God has the freedom to become human beings, animals, or anything. A child doesn’t do an activity because of a reason. When we walk, there is a reason to it but children walk for the sake of walking. When we were small, there was a Muslim family living across our house. Their little girl would knock at our door but we weren’t tall enough to open the door so our mother had to come and open the door for her. She would come and open the door. My mother would ask her “why did you come?” and she would answer “to go back”. God works like that. </span><br/><span>There are so many paths on this world. Everyone is just going to God at the end of the day. So the ultimate goal of everyone is the same. So it doesn’t matter if you practice Yoga or not. So evolution could never be stopped. There are many ways but Yoga could be a short cut way when you compare with the other ways. But, if the God was a mountain that everyone tried to reach to the peak, the natural way is the long road in which you can do sightseeing and enjoy the road. However there is also a short cut way in which you can injure yourself and it could be painful. Why don’t you prefer the long but good walk but the short and painful one to reach the peak? Also, what does Yoga feel about art?</span><br/><span>Art and imagination are parts of divinity. That is why children have interest in arts like poetry, music, etc. But people usually get easily caught up with the idea that they should be engineers or doctors. </span><br/><span>I would very much like to play violin. I also want to be an actor on the stage and be clapped. I also want to be a singer but my voice is not good. If I come to this world once again, I would like to play violin if I can. I want to come again and again until one day I can play violin. Isn’t it hurrying up when your goal is to reach the ultimate end through this road not the other? Don’t you miss something when you don’t want to be a violin player? </span><br/><span>This topic is very well discussed in the Upanishad. The happiness that you get in arts is a 100 times greater happiness than an ordinary person’s happiness. It is not only greater, but it is also a spiritual happiness. It is spiritual because when you really enjoy playing music, you don’t feel hunger when somebody eats something before you while you are playing violin. If you are truly happy in playing music, you do not even look for audiences to clap you. One of the very great musicians of South India was once singing in Bangalore. It was really wonderful. After the song was finished, everybody clapped very hard with joy. He said “I know that you really enjoy this music but you really do not know how much I enjoy singing.” Singing gives him such a joy that even the listener can not understand that. The most important thing when somebody goes through that ecstatic joy is that he becomes peaceful and calm inside. If I can not sing like him, it doesn’t mean I cannot have such a joy like him. When he sings, many people clap hands. When I sing, my wife drags me away from the house. Upanishad says “you can also have that joy because this joy is due to his mind becoming peaceful inside”. I can reach that peace with the help of Yoga. By doing Yoga I don’t deny the happiness that he gets when he sings. That’s why I am happy all the time. I may not sing like Pavarotti, play football like Maradona, or do gymnastics like Nadia Komanichi but by Yoga, I have the happiness of all these people. </span><br/><span>We are all going up the mountain; there is no doubt about it. It is when we have fear, doubt or insecurities about our journey, that is where Yoga can help you. If somebody is already happy, Yoga doesn’t want to disturb that person. That is why it is absolutely an individual decision. If a person makes Yoga, it doesn’t mean that he has lost the joy of all the sight seeing. People making Yoga do not feel regret.</span><br/><span>But I can take my time and enjoy the world where as you are trying to go up the mountain quickly. You live the beauty spiritually but I live them physically.</span><br/><span>Do you think you enjoy everything? How much can be enjoyed? There are billions f things that can make you happy but you can just see a small part of it. Out of thousands of sight seeing places, you may only enjoy 10 of them. To understand how the ocean tastes, you don’t need to drink the whole ocean. Yogi is someone who has tasted the ocean now and then, and knows how it tastes like.</span><br/><span>Is life only an ocean? There are many things tasting differently. While meditating, do you get this worldly enjoyment?</span><br/><span>You get much more intense than what the world can offer you. That is why, when you come out of meditation, it is like a fall.</span><br/><span>If the reason of my living is experiencing this world, why should I close myself and miss the world by only meditating? I am created to live as a body not only as a spirit.</span><br/><span>That is a very beautiful question. Spirituality doesn’t mean being away from this world. This is a wonderful world but we just see the top of the iceberg. It is not like a two dimensional plane. Our existence is in three dimensions. There are so many things deep inside us. We have such a depth inside, that we have dreams and many kinds of creativity. We all have a potential to become a Buddha or Jesus. Each one of us has that depth inside. To go deep into that level we need meditation. If I deny the world outside, I can never appreciate the world inside. If you can not see God in his manifestation, how can you see God in manifest? That is why we advice people not to come to spirituality as a way to escape from the world. If a person who says the world is not good, he is not accepting God. If 3 or 4 people can find peace within my presence, than I am satisfied. A true spiritual person will become accepted in the world but he doesn’t feel the need to be liable to it.</span><br/><span>Is there anyone around you doing Yoga and also is very rich? Or is it more likely that people who have experienced catastrophes are more into this spirituality?</span><br/><span>One of my very best friends in Bombay has the second biggest pharmacological company in the country. He also sincerely practices Yoga. One of the top most psychologists in Houston also practices Yoga. What is common about the people who sincerely practice Yoga? There are four different qualities. Somebody who goes through sufferings of life and can not find a solution can become spiritual. Another kind wants to get the best in the world but every time he can only get the second best. This leads to deep dissatisfaction and he goes for spirituality. The third kind of people is very intellectual and they ask for the meaning of everything. The fourth kind is by nature very quiet and peaceful. They might get a hint from somewhere that he himself has a spiritual quality.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Private Talk - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>It is not only in meditation that this happens. Many times, even in your sleep or when you are sitting very freely and relaxed, your mind gets into meditation without your knowledge. You sometimes cross that barrier of time, suddenly you are in a different time and then you get confused. You get up but you have the impressions of what you have seen. It might be about the future. Currently it doesn’t make sense but when the time gets there, you suddenly say “I know it”. You had seen it one month ago but it didn’t make any sense at that time. If the mind was aware of the past, present and the future, then the mind would get mad. Things would be confused, and you would get disturbed. That’s why it is a safety mechanism that our mind works in. In a mental person, the past, present and the future are all together and he gets confused and becomes a mental patient. It is fortunate that we have our perception of now, not the future. When all the possibilities get in your mind, you become schizophrenic.</span><br/><span>You see the mirage. The mirage is not real, but seeing the mirage is real. Even a person who knows the signs behind the mirage and knows that it cannot exist, continues to see the mirage.</span><br/><span>Do the Yogis who have supernatural powers know that the world is not real? Is this why they can do such things?</span><br/><span>The physical reality follows certain laws. I can only create an illusion that I am flying. I can cerate an illusion and you will all think that I am flying. So it is rather a hypnosis rather than Yoga. I can hypnotize you in such a way that you will think I am flying in the air. God first created the laws, and then the laws became the objects. Burning comes first, and then it becomes fire. If a Yogi denies the fire burning, that means he is denying God. You can not deny the God’s laws. The creation is based on laws.</span><br/><span>Are the paranormal powers also an illusion?</span><br/><span>It says in Bhagavat Gita that if I have a desire to do something, then the good powers help me to improve my activity. Many times, such things appear to be happening out of nowhere. Let me give an example. One time, I wanted to go to Romania. Romanian Embassy rejected my Visa. I was already in Germany then. There was a great desire from the people there that I should go to Romania. Then somehow Romanian Embassy in Germany calls me and tells me that they will give me Visa. But it was too late, and didn’t have time to go and get the Visa. They told me to come and get my Visa even if it is midnight. So I got my Visa at 23:00. How did this happen? In fact it was a miracle. The taught of me willing to go and do some good things over there made this happen. This willingness goes to their minds and then they go ahead and do it. </span><br/><span>Is this kind of like hypnosis?</span><br/><span>No it is not very much like hypnosis. These vibrations are already there, you are just catching them. </span><br/><span>In Karma principle, it is said that if you think everything positively, then good things will happen. If everything is there already, just by positive thinking, you can pick the good ones for yourself. </span><br/><span>The people who take drugs know where they can get drugs in a city first time they get there. They immediately pick up the vibrations and they interact. If you have a good heart, people with good heart will come to you, almost like accidental. Actually it is because the good vibes are attracting the good vibes of the other. </span><br/><span>But even if you have a good heart, if the other person doesn’t have that good vibes, then there is no way you can change her. There are even husbands and wives like this.</span><br/><span>Then they quarrel and get separated afterwards. If you and I are thinking in different ways, we can be together for some time but after that we separate. There is no need to match 100%. The important aspects’ matching is enough to spend a life time with that person. We might be matching with somebody else in different aspects. A wife might be matching spiritually with somebody else. </span><br/><span>Doesn’t that bring competition? </span><br/><span>You should not feel that it is a competition. You should feel that it is what you need. If you think of it this way, then you never feel competition.</span><br/><span>There are so many girls close to me. They are married but their husbands do not worry that my presence in the women’s lives is going to affect their presence in their wives’ lives.</span><br/><span>What is the difference between the schizophrenic people and us? May be we are all dreaming. How can we be sure that this world is real? There is a book of Swami Krishnananda in which he says that this world is a dream. His student asks him that the world look so real and how it could be unreal. He answers: “when you are dreaming, you never know that you are dreaming. Only after waking up, you can say that you are dreaming”. This is the analogy he was making.</span><br/><span>We should understand one thing. For a person who is dreaming, the dream is very real. When he wakes up, a consciousness looks at the dream and says that it was a dream. The inside consciousness in a dream, also becomes dream. When I look from the wakeful consciousness, my dream consciousness becomes a dream itself. Then the whole world becomes unreal. When I rise from the world consciousness to soul, then this world becomes unreal. But before that, my being in this world becomes unreal. It is not right if I consider myself real, but the world I live in unreal. We know that what we lived was a dream because we have experienced another consciousness other than the dream consciousness. Only when you are in the awake consciousness can you tell that the dream was unreal. So you have to identify yourself as out of the dream consciousness to be able to do that. </span><br/><span>When you meditate, you realize that this world is not real. But afterwards you go ahead and continue to live in this world. That means that you don’t have to reject your dream consciousness. You still know that there is a dream. </span><br/><span>I know that I had a dream last night, but again I will go back to a dream tonight. It is like this, I will once again feel that the dream is real. Nobody can be free from the dream. You see the rainbow and you know that there is no such thing as a rainbow. But still you continue to see it. It is just like the mirage example. The knowledge does not take you away from the experience. You will not be influenced by that. Your consciousness that is out of the event will be influenced but not your dream consciousness. So your wakeful consciousness will not be influenced by the dream. But the dream consciousness will be influenced by the dream. It depends on what you identify yourself with most of the time. I try to identify myself with not this consciousness. What is the difference between this consciousness and the other consciousness which is supposed to be my soul? How much I am not attached with this, gives me that consciousness. If you can not get detached, then you can never experience that consciousness. </span><br/><span>Is it possible to be detached without being Tamasic? There is a very slight difference between detachment and being ignorant. You can not be detached from just something.</span><br/><span>Care comes from loving. I love you so I care for you. So my care comes from my love much more than my attachment. My attachment makes me say:” I am important and therefore the world is important”. If I have an attachment with you and I need you all the time for my sake, it is not the attachment that cares for you. I do not care about the world if I have an attachment. If I love you then I should care for you because of you. If I tell you not to go to work because I want you with me, this is adjustment. I f I love you, you should be free to do however you want. So love cares much more than the attachment. Attachment actually is opposite of love. This is a very common mistake that we feel love and attachment are together. If I really love you, then I should have no attachment with you. </span><br/><span>It is also about trust.</span><br/><span>Yes, it is. We have a Sanskrit word called “Shraddha”. It means much more than just trust and faith. If I trust that you will do something, and you don’t do it a couple of times, then I distrust you. Trust and distrusts depends on the events outside. Shraddha does not depend on the events outside. My importance that I give to the world is Shraddha. If you have a Shraddha, then no damage can come to you. If you have Shraddha, you can put it on me or on an activity that you do. You may lose your faith in men, but just because of one person, you don’t lose faith in mankind. You can not live alone, so you have to have faith in people.</span><br/><span>This is also what Krishna says in Gita.</span><br/><span>Yes. Shraddha means basically, “yes, I am open”. So it means that if you offer me tea, I will open my cup and take it. So Shraddha means “I am ready to take”. It is like opening the windows for the sun to come in, but the sun is already there. There are two differences between faith and Shraddha. Faith basically is blind. In faith, the intellect is incapable of taking it. With Shraddha, intellect comes. The moment intellect comes, if I don’t have Shraddha, then it becomes negative. If you have Shraddha, you don’t add motive behind it but at the same time, I will judge with my intellect. Upanishad says:” how do you approach a teacher?” The answer is: “Don’t approach with faith because it is blind. Approach him with Shraddha.” It means that you can re-question whatever the teacher says. You should question it seriously, not negatively. Let me give an example. Shamivaran had a doctor friend called Dr. Clark from Harvard. There were two doctors very close to him; one was Dr. Clark and the other was Dr. Ballentine. I was with those doctors once. A heart patient came. Shamivaran told him to do some things. Ballentine said that doing another test for the patient would be better. But Dr. Clark refused, saying “Shamivaran told us to do only this one”. I asked why they couldn’t critique Shamivaran. He was not even a medical person. They told me that they had faith in Shamivaran. This is wrong. Faith does not mean that you give up your intellect. In faith, you give up intellect but in Shraddha, you don’t. Let us say you are not a medical person at all and you go to a doctor. When the doctor says something, your intellect will not help you there. You have faith in the doctor because you know he has solved similar cases before, or you know somebody whom he has cured before. So you don’t question his diagnosis. For faith, you need a track record of faith. For Shraddha, you need an intellect and an approach. People should come to me with Shraddha, not with faith because I want you to be total. Shraddha means “giving totally” but faith means” I am taking away the intellect I am giving you”. So in faith, you don’t give totally. If somebody tells me he is listening to me with faith, then I could as well have a bug listen to me because bugs don’t have intellects. I want a human being to follow me not a bug. I want an intellect and an emotion to come with my listeners. Shraddha has totality in the picture; the intellect is not kept aside like faith does. If I go the airport and they tell me that everything is all right with my ticket. Then I have a faith that I will fly tomorrow. We need faith in this world to work because the world is co complicated that you can not go into all the details yourself.</span><br/><span>If the God is the creator and he is the forgiver, what is the difference between these two ways of doing something or not doing anything?</span><br/><span>Anything is ok, provided you don’t have ego behind it. If a person is rajasic, he will be forced to things, or if he is satiric, he will work like the way you water a plant. It doesn’t matter which way you do things. If your way is rajasic, you can only be happy by forcing, if your nature is satiric you are uncomfortable with force. </span><br/><span>In case I don’t come back to life again, what will happen to me and my soul?</span><br/><span>Should something be happening? You become yourself and nothing else. You become one.</span><br/><span>Does this mean “becoming God?”</span><br/><span>The language of becoming is the language of the world. Being is not the same as becoming. </span><br/><span>What does it feel like to become one?</span><br/><span>Don’t worry about that. </span><br/><span>If there is a being, then there should also be a non-being.</span><br/><span>Our minds are full of “yes” and “no”, and “right” and “wrong”. That is why we have all these questions. </span><br/><span>Should we be asking for things, for them to happen? </span><br/><span>It is not just a matter of asking. It means you are seeking, and looking for it. You have an urge to know. It is like opening the windows for the sun to come in. If you don’t open the windows, then the sun will not come. So, there, asking doesn’t mean having questions. The moment you say you know something, you will not know any more. But if you say you don’t know, then you are open and you are seeking. Some people come to my seminars for some spiritual journey but if they don’t ask, they can not make any improvement.</span><br/><span>Some people were born in Prashanti, then how do they change?</span><br/><span>There are three things responsible for a growth. First one is our Karma, and the second one is the environment. The third one is our own effort.</span><br/><span>Why did they give up?</span><br/><span>They give up because after they were born, they get attracted by the environment that is non- spiritual. They find happiness there. If you want to go to Himalayas, you work hard to get there. Then suddenly you come to a milestone that says Himalayas is 88 km away. Then you get happy only with that and stay there. </span><br/><span>When I had a relationship, I realized afterwards that I had to allocate the time of Yoga to my partner. This could happen to anyone and it is a bit scary. If I were born in Prashanti then it would be easier. You can very easily get attracted to something but in Pradhanti it should not be that way. </span><br/><span>In Prashanti, once you get used to that routine, then you will be looking for what you are missing. That is why we need “satsang”. Prashanti can offer satsang. It is not something you should do compulsorily, you should do it voluntarily. People all over the world like my lectures and they come and listen to me. But how many of them are in Prashanti? If the personal commitment is there, then the process goes on. </span><br/><span>If you see what is there in front of you and take the right step to go ahead, it is not fatalistic. If you go to sleep thinking God will take care of everything, this is fatalistic. When you do everything that needs to be done, only then you can leave things to God. I can not go on eating junk food, and say that God will take care of it and I will not become obese. This is fatalistic. I should be taking the right food and make my exercises. In case I get a cancer only then I can surrender to God. Surrendering to God does not exclude your efforts. </span><br/><span>My Reiki teacher told me that if you want something from God, I should ask from God, and then wait for the answer instead of praying. </span><br/><span>We don’t ask God anything for ourselves. If you ask something from God, it means you are separating yourself from divinity. My hand does not ask for anything from me, because my hand is a part of me. I am a part of God, how can I ask for anything from Him? What unites us together is love. So we just go to God out of love. He is just wonderful and he is me. Only with love can we two become one. We should be praying for the mankind. We should pray for everybody to be healthy, not just us. </span><br/><span>It is said that some of the Gods can never be like the saints and the saints are higher beings than the Gods. How is this possible?</span><br/><span>These Gods have certain types of duties they are responsible of. Total internal freedom is much more superior to doing chores. Indra is basically a position. If you can deny even that position and go ahead, then you are a greater saint. Indra has given up his Indra state like a president who gives up his title. You can become so free that you can forget all about your layers. Human beings are superior because they can improve themselves. All the celestial artists are small Gods. A Guru is not just a Brahma but he is a person from high levels. </span><br/><span>Are the angels in Islam, Christianity, or any other religion like Gods in the Hindu system? </span><br/><span>In Indian philosophy that is why we have several levels of Gods which could be called as angels. These are abstract details. It is not really worthwhile to be spending much time on that. It is much more important to work on how we can free and grow ourselves. </span><br/><span>You said we should be praying for the mankind. I pray for my realization.</span><br/><span>Praying for the realization of oneself and working for the realization are not opposite to each other. It is not a bad thing to ask for realization of oneself. You surrender your ego in the form of prayer but you still continue to work. If you don’t work then you become tamastic. So it is good and necessary that we pray God for realization and nothing else. The moment I think of something else apart from realization, I separate myself out of God. </span><br/><span>The idea of Neti Neti, not his or not that, is a tool. I do not say Neti Neti for things that I do not have any connection with. I am not a Prime Minister, why should I worry about it? If you hold on to Neti Neti alone, than it leads you to negativity. It is kind of desperate. It leads you to a state of depression. Neti Neti does not have the freedom. </span><br/><span>Why would you be depressed then?</span><br/><span>You are still thinking of being somebody but you are constantly becoming nobody. Neti Neti is even worse than a failure. A failure is all right, and can be improved. But if you are not even a failure it means you are so bad. Many people don’t even attend anything because they don’t want to be a failure. Then they can’t be a success. In the process of Neti Neti you may be becoming depressed inside. It is like walking on a robe. </span><br/><span>What is the purpose of Yoga?</span><br/><span>Actually the purpose of life is very important. </span><br/><span>Then what is the purpose of life?</span><br/><span>The purpose of life is living. We constantly struggle to live, rather than living. We don’t appreciate the moment we are living. Yoga is essentially makes you feel that you are living. </span><br/><span>So the aim of Yoga is to keep me living. How is this possible? Is it with these postures or with philosophy?</span><br/><span>It is basically with philosophy that is translated into practical ways through asanas, pranayamas, etc. </span><br/><span>When we do all these asanas, does it make us live? I am not into Yoga, so what I do is struggle for living, but since you are into Yoga, you are living. Is that so? </span><br/><span>We should remove from our minds that Yoga is just doing breath exercises and some postures. They are only applications of Yoga. Yoga includes much more than that. We should be doing activities according to Yoga. This means that if you are doing an activity, you should be 100% in that activity. If I am talking, my mind, my brain and my mouth are all focusing on my talking. If I am thoroughly behind this activity that means I am living that activity. A person may not do the asanas or the pranayamas but he may be a Yogi by doing an activity in such a way. A person doing all the exercises but complaining all the time when eating is not a Yogi. </span><br/><span>I was told before that the purpose of Yogi was to prevent ourselves from being reincarnated several times and unite with the One immediately. </span><br/><span>It is not a question of being reincarnated. Without this experience people will have their own agendas, difficulties, desires, angers, etc. That causes coming back to life again. Then the world, even before you were born, is already bonded with certain agendas. The birth of a person, who has practiced Yoga and is free, will not be out of bondage but out of freedom. Such a person’s only activity will be helping others and enjoy being. Those people that we call as the saints or the prophets are such people who are in this world only for helping others. So it is not freedom from birth but freedom in birth. </span><br/><span>What do you exactly mean by freedom? What are we free of? Am I not free?</span><br/><span>For me, everybody has freedom. We also have limited purposes. A person who knows it can apply them right away. For example, something really upsetting you has happened. You may apply freedom and not worry about it. There must be degrees to applying freedom. That freedom gives us a big relief. Otherwise we would have been crushed by the life experiences. A broken heart can kill a person but we can overcome it and not worry about it. This realization, with the help of Yoga, helps us to apply freedom all the time. </span><br/><span>So you are talking about not caring.</span><br/><span>Such a person cares more consciously because he knows he has freedom inside. </span><br/><span>Let us say there is something going wrong with my job but I didn’t give much importance to it and I didn’t worry about it. A very close friend of mine has got cancer but I still didn’t worry about it. Somebody crushed my car and I didn’t worry about that either. Is this what you are mean by freedom?</span><br/><span>Let me give you an example. Two years ago I was supposed to travel to USA. There was no problem about my visas, passports, etc. Everything was ready months ago. I went to Bombay airports 3 hours ago for the check in. When I went there I realized that there was a big crowd there and a big commotion was going on. I asked what had happened. They said that the plane was already booked and they were not going to take any more seats. I told them that I had a ticket and a reserved seat. They told me that all the other men had the same things and that is why they are fighting. I could also fight or get angry and shout. But because of my peaceful calm nature, I enquired why this mistake had happened. They told me that normally 20% of the tickets were cancelled and that is why they had oversold the tickets. Legally they were all right. I asked them what the alternative for me could be. They told me I could fly tomorrow and they would pay me for all the extra expenses. I thought and came to the idea that I was not going to lose anything by going one day late. I could understand that person’s difficulty and I felt compassionate for him. I could fight with him and spoil both his mind and my mind. However I accepted his offer and told him to fix me a room from a hotel. The man was shocked. He couldn’t believe that I had said ok and not fight with him. I talked with the other passengers who were fighting and tried to convince them into my solution. I convinced a few passengers and in 10 minutes, all the commotion was gone. Because of my peaceful nature and compassion for people, I could go on positively. Let me give you the philosophical background behind it. Brahman and the Atman are the total peaceful states. Immediately next to them comes love, compassion and sense of wonder as manifestations. We call these three things “beauty”. When we limit these with ego, then comes the other feelings like hate. When we give up ego, love, compassion and sense of wonder will come up to the surface. That is why all the prophets manifested nothing but pure love, compassion and sense of wonder. Yoga helps us do this.</span><br/><span>Why have the human beings been created?</span><br/><span>The material world has the cause and the effect. We always look for a reason. There is always a purpose and an act behind it. But the divine does not work with the equation of cause and affect. So such a question, when you look from a spiritual point of view, is because of God’s freedom to create human beings. In Sanskrit way, we can say the God has become human beings. God has the freedom to become human beings, animals, or anything. A child doesn’t do an activity because of a reason. When we walk, there is a reason to it but children walk for the sake of walking. When we were small, there was a Muslim family living across our house. Their little girl would knock at our door but we weren’t tall enough to open the door so our mother had to come and open the door for her. She would come and open the door. My mother would ask her “why did you come?” and she would answer “to go back”. God works like that. </span><br/><span>There are so many paths on this world. Everyone is just going to God at the end of the day. So the ultimate goal of everyone is the same. So it doesn’t matter if you practice Yoga or not. So evolution could never be stopped. There are many ways but Yoga could be a short cut way when you compare with the other ways. But, if the God was a mountain that everyone tried to reach to the peak, the natural way is the long road in which you can do sightseeing and enjoy the road. However there is also a short cut way in which you can injure yourself and it could be painful. Why don’t you prefer the long but good walk but the short and painful one to reach the peak? Also, what does Yoga feel about art?</span><br/><span>Art and imagination are parts of divinity. That is why children have interest in arts like poetry, music, etc. But people usually get easily caught up with the idea that they should be engineers or doctors. </span><br/><span>I would very much like to play violin. I also want to be an actor on the stage and be clapped. I also want to be a singer but my voice is not good. If I come to this world once again, I would like to play violin if I can. I want to come again and again until one day I can play violin. Isn’t it hurrying up when your goal is to reach the ultimate end through this road not the other? Don’t you miss something when you don’t want to be a violin player? </span><br/><span>This topic is very well discussed in the Upanishad. The happiness that you get in arts is a 100 times greater happiness than an ordinary person’s happiness. It is not only greater, but it is also a spiritual happiness. It is spiritual because when you really enjoy playing music, you don’t feel hunger when somebody eats something before you while you are playing violin. If you are truly happy in playing music, you do not even look for audiences to clap you. One of the very great musicians of South India was once singing in Bangalore. It was really wonderful. After the song was finished, everybody clapped very hard with joy. He said “I know that you really enjoy this music but you really do not know how much I enjoy singing.” Singing gives him such a joy that even the listener can not understand that. The most important thing when somebody goes through that ecstatic joy is that he becomes peaceful and calm inside. If I can not sing like him, it doesn’t mean I cannot have such a joy like him. When he sings, many people clap hands. When I sing, my wife drags me away from the house. Upanishad says “you can also have that joy because this joy is due to his mind becoming peaceful inside”. I can reach that peace with the help of Yoga. By doing Yoga I don’t deny the happiness that he gets when he sings. That’s why I am happy all the time. I may not sing like Pavarotti, play football like Maradona, or do gymnastics like Nadia Komanichi but by Yoga, I have the happiness of all these people. </span><br/><span>We are all going up the mountain; there is no doubt about it. It is when we have fear, doubt or insecurities about our journey, that is where Yoga can help you. If somebody is already happy, Yoga doesn’t want to disturb that person. That is why it is absolutely an individual decision. If a person makes Yoga, it doesn’t mean that he has lost the joy of all the sight seeing. People making Yoga do not feel regret.</span><br/><span>But I can take my time and enjoy the world where as you are trying to go up the mountain quickly. You live the beauty spiritually but I live them physically.</span><br/><span>Do you think you enjoy everything? How much can be enjoyed? There are billions f things that can make you happy but you can just see a small part of it. Out of thousands of sight seeing places, you may only enjoy 10 of them. To understand how the ocean tastes, you don’t need to drink the whole ocean. Yogi is someone who has tasted the ocean now and then, and knows how it tastes like.</span><br/><span>Is life only an ocean? There are many things tasting differently. While meditating, do you get this worldly enjoyment?</span><br/><span>You get much more intense than what the world can offer you. That is why, when you come out of meditation, it is like a fall.</span><br/><span>If the reason of my living is experiencing this world, why should I close myself and miss the world by only meditating? I am created to live as a body not only as a spirit.</span><br/><span>That is a very beautiful question. Spirituality doesn’t mean being away from this world. This is a wonderful world but we just see the top of the iceberg. It is not like a two dimensional plane. Our existence is in three dimensions. There are so many things deep inside us. We have such a depth inside, that we have dreams and many kinds of creativity. We all have a potential to become a Buddha or Jesus. Each one of us has that depth inside. To go deep into that level we need meditation. If I deny the world outside, I can never appreciate the world inside. If you can not see God in his manifestation, how can you see God in manifest? That is why we advice people not to come to spirituality as a way to escape from the world. If a person who says the world is not good, he is not accepting God. If 3 or 4 people can find peace within my presence, than I am satisfied. A true spiritual person will become accepted in the world but he doesn’t feel the need to be liable to it.</span><br/><span>Is there anyone around you doing Yoga and also is very rich? Or is it more likely that people who have experienced catastrophes are more into this spirituality?</span><br/><span>One of my very best friends in Bombay has the second biggest pharmacological company in the country. He also sincerely practices Yoga. One of the top most psychologists in Houston also practices Yoga. What is common about the people who sincerely practice Yoga? There are four different qualities. Somebody who goes through sufferings of life and can not find a solution can become spiritual. Another kind wants to get the best in the world but every time he can only get the second best. This leads to deep dissatisfaction and he goes for spirituality. The third kind of people is very intellectual and they ask for the meaning of everything. The fourth kind is by nature very quiet and peaceful. They might get a hint from somewhere that he himself has a spiritual quality.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Questions and Answers","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":204,"uuid":"b7b72661-3d67-485f-a70f-2a20bc953168","title":"Talk on Prana","slug":"talk-on-prana","markdown":"<p><span>Private Meeting - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Thank you for inviting me to this group.</span><br/><span>Every time a child is born, through the child, God is sending us a message that he still has hope on the human beings. We will try to make that hope of God live, by the groups of this nature.</span><br/><span>We have to constantly work to see how the human beings are together. The Sanskrit word for unity is what yoga is. So yoga is a practical science of uniting and being together. The essential spiritual nature of creation is this wonderful harmony. Look at a plant. The roots are under the earth and the flowers are towards the sky. But there is a wonderful harmony between the roots and fruits. This harmony shows the health of the plant. If you look at an orange you will again see harmony between the bitter outer layer of the orange and the sweet fruit and the bitter seed inside. The seed does not disturb the fruit and the fruit does not disturb the seed. They are born together and live together in harmony within the same fruit. When there is such a harmony in a fruit, why can’t we have this in human beings? If there is any enemy of man, it is only another man or as Bhagavad-Gita says he is his own enemy. We have to bring man closer to man in harmony by yoga. There are hundreds of ways by which we can put them together. But it can only be possible if I have the harmony inside me. So the journey starts from me. A flower has a fragrance and then it gives it to all around it self. Similarly if I have harmony inside, I can spread this harmony to the world.</span><br/><span>But look at the human being. With human beings the mind says something and the body says something else. Within the mind also one part of the mind says yes while the other part says no. Why we can’t have this harmony.</span><br/><span>In God’s creation there is such a wonderful harmony. We have very hard teeth but in between we have a very soft tongue. Look at the wonderful harmony between the tongue and the teeth. They not only do not disturb each other but they protect and help each other. Only when we are anxious they can disturb one another. If we are peaceful, there is harmony. Therefore disharmony is the sign of anxiety.</span><br/><span>Basically yoga is harmony and yoga is peace. It is easier said than done. Just by asking mind will not be peaceful. Now the question is about how to get to that harmony and peace. We have several different techniques to reach harmony. So many yoga masters ever since ancient times have given us various techniques according to the need of the people at that time. Five thousand years ago someone has given us Kriya Yoga. Three thousand years ago somebody gave us Ashtanga Yoga. A thousand years ago somebody gave us Siddha Yoga. Recently Mahesh yogi came and gave us transcendental meditation. Definitely hundred years later somebody will come and give us another kind of yoga. The names and the practices may be different but the goal is the same. The only single goal they have is peace, harmony and those techniques which will not give us this goal of peace and harmony they are quake systems.</span><br/><span>Why not we have only one system and why do we have so many techniques then? It is because we have different varieties of people with different varieties of minds. That is why what may suit you, might not suit me. What technique may be useful for someone may not be useful for some one else. That is why we have so many varieties of techniques. Not everybody has to like the same thing. It does not mean that they have to fight and be against each other. This is what Swami Vivekananda said a hundred years ago in the Parliament of Religions. There are hundreds of ways to reach to God’s place- the peace of mind. But the goal is the same in all of them. We choose what is good for us and reach a peace of mind. One of the biggest disturbances is in the inner life force called Prana. When the mind is agitated, you can see the agitation in the energy of the body.</span><br/><span>Anger, depression, schizophrenia are all mental disturbances. They percolate into the life force, Prana and make it very agitated. Yoga says, if can get my mind to peace, then my body becomes peaceful and calm. If you can set the harmony between inhale and exhale, between systolic and diastolic, then you can see the harmony in your mind. Let us see the case somebody has panicked in a traffic accident and he is disturbed. All he needs to do is calm down and take deep breaths. You can see his panic level comes down. Once his mind is calm he in not in panic any more.</span><br/><span>We do this to a lot of children having anxieties because of exams. We make them sit down and take deep breaths before the exams. We can see that once their panic levels come down, their recollection, memories and responses are better. We have done many research studies to prove how a calming down in the prana level can bring down an absolutely wonderful performance. This prana is sometimes translated as energy. This is not like the physical energy we measure in calories. This is the life energy within us. We are all born with a storehouse of this life energy. The faster we spend this energy, the older we become. When we slow down this process, we live longer. Respiration is one of the manifestations of this inner life energy. That is the reason why the animals that have faster respiratory rates live shorter. Animals having slower respiratory rates like elephants or crocodiles live longer. We may also see the benefit this way that as the way we breathe we are exhausted at the end of the day. But if we can reduce the speed we are not exhausted at the end of the day!</span><br/><span>Pranayama practices are about how we can slow down this inner life force. People who practice for two weeks at our center can bring down their respiration rates from 20-22/ a minute to 15-16/a minute. People with hypertension and heart sicknesses always have high respiratory rates. According to Ayurveda, a high respiratory rate is a disease all by itself. People practicing pranayama continuously for 2-3 years have around 10-12 respirations in one minute. We have seen people who regularly meditate and do pranayama have respiratory rates of 1-2 /a minute. That means our lungs do not have to work as much as 20 times per minute but 1 or 2 by the help of yoga. Once you can bring that down, then you can realize how enjoyable the life itself is. Exhaustion will not be there, we will be much more relaxed all the time and the remaining prana can be used for other activities. You can observe that such a person is peaceful in everything he does.</span><br/><span>Yoga says that if you have established in peace, people coming close to you can also feel that peace. Naturally this is something one has to experience. This is not something that can be taught but it is a feeling of that peaceful nature. How slow can we go with that prana? There is a story that comes in ‘Ramayana’. There is a person searching for a saint. He realizes that within a couple of miles to that saint the flowers are always fresh and the grass is always green. He can see liveliness all around.</span><br/><span>He goes to the saint and humbly says “you must be really great because I see your influence”. “What kind of a meditation do you do to become such a saint?”</span><br/><span>He answers “I am not very educated to do types of meditation. I am a very simple person. People say the best way of meditation is to slow down the respiration. That is pranayama.”</span><br/><span>The man asks” what do you mean by slowing the breath?”. “It means slowly inhale and slowly exhale”. The man asks “how slow do you do that?” He answers “with one inhale and one exhale, one generation passes”. The man says” you never die”, and the saint says “I saw many people passing away in front of me”. The issue is not about dying or not but if the breath can be so slow, how blessed the life can be.</span><br/><span>We spend so much prana that at the end of the day we are very tired. If we can slow down the breath and the whole inner activity, at the end of the day you will be as fresh as you were in the morning. That freshness is our health.</span><br/><span>That harmony is the spiritual health. A person who is peaceful inside and has harmony can only spread harmony to the world. We have a few techniques to see how our mind is there on the respiration. At the beginning we will see how we can slow down the breath. After that, we will leave that technique aside but we will continue to have slow breath. Once we identify the gap between inhalation and exhalation, we can go to superior levels of our consciousness. You can see that there are huge subconscious levels of us hiding behind very little conscious levels outside. The world is so busy with shallow conscious levels that we do not know the depth levels of subconscious that we have. A person who can go to his subconscious levels can not develop anger any more. This is how Pranayama leads us to meditation.</span><br/><span>Question and Answer Session</span><br/><span>What is the difference between Atman and Brahman?</span><br/><span>Prana is the energy what is behind our activities. When it becomes softer and softer, it has greater degrees of freedom. That itself is called Atman. Why do we worry about something indescribable as Brahma? The important thing is it is indescribable but it is something that can be experienced. It is such a wonderful experience that it is god who would make us experience this. How can we share other than words and words are very inadequate tool to share this expereince?</span><br/><span>Could you describe the word “aum”? What is the effect of “aum” on human beings?</span><br/><span>Basically these are the two letters that are active in our mental activity. Mind mostly functions in the form of dialogues. It is all like the way we talk outside we will be talking inside too. This talking in the language we are familiar with. What ever language we talk it all has these essential features. At one end which is the beginning of all our dialogues it is “a”. Every language has therefore the first letter as ‘a’. ‘A’ is the sound we produce with the mouth fully open and we can not do any thing below. And the other end is “m”. ‘M’ is the sound we produce with mouth fully closed and we can not do any thing beyond that! A is the beginning. Below “a” there is no sound we make. It is the sound you make with your mouth full open. The first sound that a child makes is “a”. The last sound that makes sense is “m”. The sound “m” is made by the mouth fully closed. You can not make any more sound beyond that. All the words, the sounds, the anger, the feelings, and everything else you speak are in between “a” and “m”. If I draw two lines graphically with one of them being “a” and the other “m”, all the dialogues will be within these two lines. When you join this ‘a’ and ‘m’ together, then it envelopes all the other things. ‘A’ and ‘M’ joining together represents the whole creation. That is why we have “amen” and “aum”. The sound which is produced by joining them therefore represents creation.</span><br/><span>Let me tell you the benefits of this in practice. The world that matters to us is the dialogues that are going down inside us. Whatever the dialogue is that is going on inside, the moment you say “aum” or “amen” it envelopes all the dialogues that have been inside. There can be no dialogue inside you that can escape from “aum” or “amen”. Whenever we say “aum” it envelopes all the sounds of the mind. The moment we stop saying “aum”, Aum itself dissolves. When it dissolves, you go into a “no-mind” state. Aum is important because of that silence. Every time we pronounce “aum” we reach that profound state of silence. Saying it repeatedly, slowly we can reach that “no-mind” state. That is basically the reason why “aum” is added to almost every spiritual sound. It is that state where you are awake but your mind is resting. We normally have an experience of body resting but mind not. The body rests, the prana rests, and even the mind rests after “aum”. It is after that silence that all the creation takes place. One can experience how creation comes out of this silence. That is why we are in touch with Brahman and Atman. It is still unexplainable because the words become silence in this, and the explanation we will give will not satisfy the actual Brahman. Aum is bigger than all the words. That is the reason why they say that is the state that can not be explained but it can be experienced.</span><br/><span>Is it possible to increase the life energy inside us? I do not mean using it properly; I mean can we increase it?</span><br/><span>What we do is not increasing the energy. We tune such a way that we attract similar kinds of energy which is the intention called as ‘sankalpa’ together and manifest very big activities. We become the core and all the other similar intentions can join that.</span><br/><span>What energies are you referring to? How are we going to absorb them?</span><br/><span>There are several people who have same kind of intentions and same kind of passion. If I strongly manifest my passion and my energy and my prana, then I will have the capacity to attract similar kind of minds and energies. Then it starts to become like a big wave. The only way we are separated from that force is our arrogance.</span><br/><span>This is the reason that when we want to do some thing we find that some unknown forces come together without our planning and make things possible. We think that we are lucky and things look like coincident. But the explanation given is that they are not coincident but the influence of these subtle forces which have given the energy for our activity.</span><br/><span>What is levitation?</span><br/><span>I would consider that all these physical laws are the manifestations of God himself. Anything I do to deny any of the physical laws is going against the God’s will. The first thing is I feel I need to reach divinity. Sailing against the wind of God is basically our arrogance. Trying to break some of the nature’s laws for me seems to be not a very happy idea of yoga. There is another God’s law that is creating a world of illusion. Even though there is no water, showing that there is water is an illusion. That is what we call a “mirage”. Similarly when there is no object actually as rainbow, seeing a rainbow is a mirage. It looks like it is valid in the nature’s law but it is not there and you see it. Levitation can be seen as an illusion which is not there but we see it. I feel that we do it by psychedelic energy.</span><br/><span>Bears go to sleep for months. During that time his respiration rate goes very slow. When a bear can do it subconsciously, how can human beings can not do it?</span><br/><span>There are three types of animals going in hibernation. They are frogs, snakes, and bears. Nature has provided them with hibernation abilities. When the animal hibernates there is most minimum activity of survival and all the rest of the activity is conserved. This capacity is provided to the animals so that they will not be struggling for food when the food is not available like in winter. This is actually the only indication that has inspired human beings that he can also try to hibernate. In the case of animals when they are in hibernation there is no development or growth taking place. This is a law of nature. But when we consciously hibernate it is a spiritual growth. That is one of the reasons why we try to go into a peaceful state of mind. It is like a consciously made hibernation. Mandukya Upanishad talks about this. It especially talks about frogs. Frogs go to hibernation as a natural phenomenon which is supposed to be the fourth state of consciousness. We normally know three state of consciousness. These are wakeful state of consciousness, dream-state of consciousness, and deep-sleep state of consciousness. Beyond these three, we have a fourth one. The indication of this fourth state of consciousness is all these hibernating animals. If I go to that fourth state of consciousness consciously, that is what we call a meditation. A frog goes to the fourth state of consciousness but stays as a frog. This is natural for it. But when a human being does that he becomes a Buddha.</span><br/><span>Could you talk about the concept of chaos in harmony?</span><br/><span>This is a little bit difficult subject so please bear with me. In the nature, chaos and harmony are never separated. We think they are opposite but in fact in nature, they are always together and complimentary to each other. Look at a tree and you will see that the leaves are similar. There is an absolute harmony. When you closely observe and compare the leaves, you will see that they are totally different. There is a total chaos. There is a chaos but there is also harmony there. Every tree has leaves, roots and trunks within a wonderful harmony. The moment you see it from a distance you can tell it is a tree and see what is the species and variety. When you come close, you see that no tree is like another tree. Similarly if you take even our cells; there is a similarity and you can see an absolute matching. But if you more closely observe, you will see they are different and in chaos. The continuity of the creation takes place because of the combination of harmony and chaos. Harmony brings the discipline. Chaos brings absolute and infinite creation. If only harmony is there, creation will die. Similarly if only chaos is there, creation will again die.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Private Meeting - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Thank you for inviting me to this group.</span><br/><span>Every time a child is born, through the child, God is sending us a message that he still has hope on the human beings. We will try to make that hope of God live, by the groups of this nature.</span><br/><span>We have to constantly work to see how the human beings are together. The Sanskrit word for unity is what yoga is. So yoga is a practical science of uniting and being together. The essential spiritual nature of creation is this wonderful harmony. Look at a plant. The roots are under the earth and the flowers are towards the sky. But there is a wonderful harmony between the roots and fruits. This harmony shows the health of the plant. If you look at an orange you will again see harmony between the bitter outer layer of the orange and the sweet fruit and the bitter seed inside. The seed does not disturb the fruit and the fruit does not disturb the seed. They are born together and live together in harmony within the same fruit. When there is such a harmony in a fruit, why can’t we have this in human beings? If there is any enemy of man, it is only another man or as Bhagavad-Gita says he is his own enemy. We have to bring man closer to man in harmony by yoga. There are hundreds of ways by which we can put them together. But it can only be possible if I have the harmony inside me.

Similarly if only chaos is there, creation will again die.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Talk on Prana","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":205,"uuid":"f032e733-e738-4c93-bb63-af258c1de433","title":"Talk on Hyperactivity","slug":"talk-on-hyperactivity","markdown":"<p><span>Raghuramji - The President of the 1st Yoga Festival - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Before we start the session, I would like to start with a brief meditation.</span><br/><span>I will give you the instructions:</span><br/><span>You may sit cross-legged.

Bend forward while exhaling. And saying ‘aum’… Aum…</span><br/><span>In English, the word “man” comes from the word “mind”. Also in Sanskrit, the word “man” comes from the word “mind”. One who has a mind, is a man. When we say man here, we do not only mean the male but also the female. The important aspect of human being is the mind. Essentially, the idea of yoga is to see how we can develop in harmony at the mind level. When there is harmony, there will be peace of mind. It is easier said than done.</span><br/><span>What we really need to look at is how to get into that peaceful state of mind. There are very few people on the streets whose minds are naturally peaceful. They were born with a peace of mind. They really do not have to do anything. Nothing can disturb their minds. There are two types of people. One category of people who have peace of mind but they do not do any constructive activity. They are very dull and they are not really useful to the society. In the understanding of yoga they appear to be peaceful but in reality they are not but their disturbances are in the seed form. But people in the other category are very peaceful and very creative at the same time. Yoga wants people to have peaceful minds and at the same time be creative. When we look at the non-creative people, they do not even exercise their minds. They do not make any activity and they are just above the simple material level. They do not fight against the challenges or the difficulties of life. Therefore they are not creative or active at all. When we put these people in some kind of an activity, we see that they really suffer. If you can put them in protection, then they can not harm themselves. This is the category of people who have not yet been evolved. Looking at the other people who are active, we can say that they have evolved.</span><br/><span>A person who is active or hyperactive has lots of creativity and has lots of ideas unlike a dull person. A dull person is not sensitive. An active or hyperactive person is already sensitive. Sensitivity is growth. We need to develop sensitivity. Developments in technology and science are actually making us more and more sensitive. Hundred years ago people were not this sensitive. A person who is sensitive is a person who is developed. Sensitivity is growth. In hundred years of time, people will be much more sensitive than us.</span><br/><span>Let me give a simple example regarding this. Hundred years ago men did not have a cleanness concept. But today we have developed and we wonder how people lived at those times. We are also sensitive to information these days. Thanks to the information technology growth. People wonder about how they used to live without a radio or a television. We wonder how they lived without knowing what is going on around the world. Today we have all these things available.</span><br/><span>Hundred years ago traveling to U.S.A. took three months by boat. Today you can go anywhere very fast. I wonder how people could take a trip as three months to go to America. Hundred years later, things will be totally different. We are now sensitive to spending such a time in travel. May be people in future will look at our televisions and think how primitively we have lived. This is how the sensitivity grows as the technology develops. Another thing is the inner speed. We complain about the speed out side. But the real problem is not outer speed but it is the inner speed which is a problem. Let me state an example which is common for most of us. When I was at school, I used to visit my brother who was working at a bank. At the bank, they used to keep a notebook called daybook to keep track of everything that was done at that day. They had to add the four to six digit number and it used to take around 15 minutes which they used to do leisurely. Today we have computers and all the data is on the computers. All you need to do to close the day is just hit a button and the computer adds. In one minute, the calculation is finished. We are restless. If we wait just a few seconds more, we start complaining. Twenty years ago, men would give 15-20 minutes where as today, we can not wait for even 15 seconds. This means that the outside world is getting faster and faster but our inside world moves much faster than that.</span><br/><span>The outside world has become fast and inside world has become faster. The outside world gets more sensitive but the inside gets even more extra sensitive. Outside becomes active and the inside becomes hyperactive. Hyperactivity does not belong to outside but to our inside.</span><br/><span>To learn about hyperactivity is to actually see within. A simple experiment our philosophy asks us to try to sit quiet for some time and see what happens. We can sit for 5-10 minutes. May be that will create a force inside because we will get restless. We want to do something or we will get bored. The way hyperactivity manifests in us is in the form of boredom. Boredom, hyperactivity and hypersensitivity are very closely connected. Less developed countries have less problems of hyperactivity. When the country is less developed, people do not complain about boredom also. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did not have televisions or radios but they never complained about boredom. My grandfather used to come from the field and sit comfortably in his chair without any complaints. My father, being the next generation, used to complain about boredom in his 40-50s. In my own generation, this boredom starts with the early ages like 20s. Fifty years ago a child of six or seven years hardly used to complain about boredom. Fifty years later look at my son he started to complain about boredom when he was 6 years old. This hyperactivity and boredom start to be seen in people at earlier ages. The reason appears to be the technological progress we see. When we did not have all these play things etc we were less restless. With all the supports to engage us today we are growing more and more restless. A more developed country has greater problem of this. That is why we can see small children being hyperactive and complaining about boredom in developed countries more than in the developing countries. If we don’t solve this problem now, a couple of generations later, the children will be born not by crying but by saying “I’m bored”.Maxim Gorky a Russian noble laureate when he visited USA once, was taken round the various places of entertainment, as they wanted to show him how rich America is and how much people have. At the end of the whole tour Gorky said with sad face wondered how poor people are! The officials who were with him asked do you mean Russian people who do not have such things. He said no I am talking about Americans who need so many things to engage them otherwise they get bored! I am sorry about the restlessness in American public.</span><br/><span>We somehow need to get rid of this restlessness. Let me come to some ideas of yoga. Inside our body, there are no different kinds of energies. There is only energy that we call the life energy, prana. Prana is responsible for our respiration and activities. It is also responsible for boredom and restlessness. When we can not control prana, it becomes restless. When we have control over it, then we become better people. This restless energy goes more to the brain region. As the pressure gets bigger we somehow spend it away. What normally do we do when we are restless? We walk to spend that energy away. Another way to get rid of the energy is to gossip. It gives such a wonderful relief. You throw away your inner restlessness and the emptiness is created inside. What you enjoy in gossip is that emptiness. Some people smoke to get rid of this restlessness. When you smoke, the nicotine takes away the restless energy and you get rid of it. Sex is another way to get rid of this restless energy. We have several sensory organs through which we involve in activities. These are all the centers through which we spend this restless energy. These centers are called the chakras. Basically, when we feel the urge to smoke, it is because of the restlessness inside not because of the mouth or lungs. What is wrong if we spend this energy in the form of sex, smoking etc.? What happens is that, they take away our restlessness when we are in contact with objects but it comes back to us soon as we are denied of the object, afterwards. The problem with these ways of spending the energy is that they make the mind much more restless. After involving in a gossip, you feel the relief first. But afterwards, you observe that your mind become much more complex. All these methods to spend that energy have evil attached. Spending this restless energy by hyperactivity is unhealthy. Gardening on the other hand is a wonderful way of spending this energy. But today we have so many concrete buildings that there are almost no gardens at all. In India, women knit while they wait for the bus at the bus stop. I am sure same way women do activities all over the world. That is a way wonderful way of spending their restless energy inside. I always wonder why women have such wonderful activities but not men. Therefore women always are knitting to conquer their restlessness where the men spend restlessness by smoking in India. Smoking is a problem for the health where as knitting is not. Another way people spend their restless energy is by eating. The whole bubblegum business survives on our restless. Probably the bubblegum business will be even better as we get more and more restless. That is how we spend that energy and become peaceful.</span><br/><span>In all these activities, we spend that energy but we do not address the basic issue as to how not to become restless inside again. This is a very important point. Spending the restless energy is important but how not to become restless is much more important. Essentially, yoga works in that area.</span><br/><span>The role of the yoga is to make you less restless inside. One of the most important key factors in yoga to control that restlessness is being aware. Being aware of yourself, you will be able to control your restlessness.</span><br/><span>There are two ways of looking at this awareness. There is a positive and negative awareness. One of the greatest thinkers of India is Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He used to tell a simple story to explain this awareness. There was a farm house in a land of 100 acres and there was a watchman for this house. This watchman used to travel around the farm and check if everything was all right. He was a very good watchman. He used to know all the details about the farm. If anything was missing in the farm, he would be aware of it. If there was a thief or an animal jumped into the farm, making a sound, he would be aware of that too. He would recognize any small sound. That is his job. He does this job only for the 8 hours that is his work hours. After that he becomes tired and he could not continue that awareness as a watchman for more than 8 hours. He would like to break off! If he does more than one day he becomes sick.</span><br/><span>And there is another person who also has awareness. His awareness is of different nature. He knows what things are available in the farm house. If there was a problem in the car, he could go into his garage and get the necessary equipment to fix it. If a guest comes, he knows in garden, which tree to pick the good fruits from. He is aware for 24 hours, and he is the owner of the farm house. Those 24 hours of awareness is not a burden on him. A watchman’s awareness is a burden after 8 hours; where as the owner’s awareness is not a burden for 24 hours. Watchman’s awareness is a pressure where as the owner’s awareness is a relief. What is the difference between the watchman’s awareness and the owner’s awareness? The watchman’s awareness is always the awareness of negativity. Watchman’s awareness is around what is wrong, where is the weakness, where the thief, etc can enter. The owner’s awareness is a positive awareness. Ramakrishna used to say that the watchman’s awareness is bad, but the owner’s awareness is good. Watchman’s awareness is a burden but the owner’s awareness is a relief. God sent you not as a watchman of your body but as the owners of your body. Ramakrishna therefore suggested don’t have watchman’s awareness on you, have owner’s awareness. A hyperactive person is generally thinking what is wrong. We are tutored to think that the more negativity we see, the more intelligent we are. We think that if we can find fault, we are great. While listening to music, when we see a small fault and point-out the mistake, we feel proud that we know about music. Education is making us more and more negative aware people.</span><br/><span>Yoga awareness is about positive awareness. If you become more and more negatively aware, then the world looks negative. It is very easy to see something that is negative. In a white sheet, we can immediately see a black spot. You do not need to put any effort to see that black dot. Mind very easily goes to that negative awareness. The closer you look at something, the more negative you see. This is how we get closer to hyperactivity and negative awareness. We have to develop consciously positive awareness.</span><br/><span>When you look at a rose garden, there are actually more thorns than roses. One flower at least has ten thorns. The more you look at these thorns you wonder why they call it the rose garden instead of the thorn garden. That is right according to the democratic ideas also. When you start negative awareness, it is like looking at the thorns instead of the roses. The more you look at the thorns; you may even start blaming the rose flower the more. Then you can say that the flower is having a conspiracy against you. The flower is attracting you and therefore the thorns can harm you. When you start looking at the negative, even the positive will appear negative to you and you feel you are really smart.</span><br/><span>On the other hand, the more you see the flowers, the more you appreciate the garden. If you look at the flowers, you may even appreciate the thorns. You may start saying that the thorn is beautifully placed there to protect the rose. Yoga tries to improve positive awareness. The first help of yoga to come out of hyperactivity is to learn to look at everything positively.</span><br/><span>Let us look at our daily life. What do you do first when you get up in the morning? You look at the clock. It is time that you have to get up. You have a lot of things to do. A horrible day has started again, you curse the day! But you can’t help it. You start the day with negativity! Yoga says, stop all these. Think about the positive things. Before you start any activity just spend 10-15 minutes thinking of the positive things. Then your day becomes positive.</span><br/><span>The practice of yoga gives a great advantage to you. When you stretch you body, your muscles excite hundreds of neurons in your brain. When you stretch the body, these neurons get activated. Activated neurons add to your awareness. By stretching your body, you are actually developing your awareness. Awareness is nothing but trying to build a harmony between the mind and the body. When you stretch your body in the yoga, use this awareness and look at the stretch positively. When you do that, your stretches will be able to take you to deeper levels of relaxation. Don’t worry about your pains or the bending that you can not do. Think about it positively and think you can do so much. That positive awareness will help you go to a positive relaxation.</span><br/><span>This relaxation will make you less restless. Try to do the practices of yoga slowly and gently. The positive awareness helps you to agree with self in just a moment. Stay in the final posture. Allow yourself to observe all the changes taken place in your body. Observe your blood flow and pulse rate. Listen to the vibes inside your body dispassionately. All these will help you to go to deeper relaxations. Thereby you are actually trying to reduce your inner hyperactivity. You will not lose your sensitivity meanwhile. Once you are peaceful inside, you can always bring in energy when an activity is needed.</span><br/><span>This is valid for the second category of people I have explained earlier namely the people who are basically very sensitive but they are not restless. They can do the activity calmly but they do not need to become hyperactive. They are aware of everything but they do not react. Actually you can do a set of exercises to see how aware you are inside. In Sanskrit the word pragna which is translated to English as “awareness”. There is no better word for it than awareness. Awareness is always object oriented. Awareness always has “of what?” Where as pragna is not object oriented, it is subject oriented. Pragna is a state inside, not a state from outside. We are aware of all the things around the world. We are aware of what is happening in America in India; we are aware of the politics today. We are aware of all these things but we are never aware of our inside. This is not pragna; it is awareness alright but not pragna.The practice we will do today is about how to bring bout that awareness from outside to inside. We will see how our blood flows and how our heart works. We will see how we can enter the sound resonance, and see the various impulses of the nerves. We will improve our awareness about all these activities. This is done basically by reducing the scattered and fragmented awareness out side. Finally we will eliminate all the things and we will become mere awareness. That mere awareness is what is called the pragna. Other objects, we have to show with the help of light. Even the moon can not be seen without the sun light. We don’t need another light to see self. Pragna is light itself. With the help of pragna, we can see other objects. Once we become pragna, then we can bring the pragna into all our actions. If you do this yoga practice 45 minutes a day you can become pragna yourself. Once you bring in pragna in all your activities, your activities will neither become dull or hyperactive. You will be wonderfully active and at the same time you will not be hyperactive. You will be the master of the activities; the activities will not be your masters. You are here and now. I can answer a few questions now.</span><br/><span>Question and answer session:</span><br/><span>What is the person when he is having this awareness?This question was asked by Arjuna to Krishna in the second chapter of Bhagavad-Gita. There he asks what a person is like in the state of pragna. To be aware of everything outside us, science helps us. Science does not have any prescription for inner awareness. Your self awareness is what the yoga alone can do. In this respect yoga is not against the science, it supports science.</span><br/><span>We are very much object- oriented. Do we have to spend some time alone and quiet?</span><br/><span>We are trained by the present day life style to live in object orientation. We have no opportunity to be in subject orientation. That is the way meditation practice is to be taken. This is essentially to be quiet and take this quietness into deeper inner layers of us.</span><br/><span>When there is a hyperactive person in front of me I try to be calm. When I am calm, he gets more hyperactive.</span><br/><span>A person in the state of awareness would never harm another person. A person who is aware could only help others to grow. If that person’s silence is going to help the other person, he will remain silence. If that person’s silence will make the other one even more hyperactive, he will be silent inside and will not allow his silence to exhibit outside which can harm other person. So he will show his emotion with out getting caught up in emotions so that the other person will mend himself. A person who has established a world of pragna can never harm the outside world. I would like to give an example from my son. He was very peaceful at school. His friends used to tease him and make fun of him. He would come home and cry. All the others have told him not to fight with those kids. But my son used to say that the quieter I am, the more they tease me. I told my son without loosing awareness to go and show his strength to them because he was strong enough. But do not keep any anger within you while doing this. The next day he went and just showed his strength to them. Afterwards they all became good friends of him. When I say be peaceful, I do not mean lose your self respect. You know our Indian gods. One of their hands is in the pose of granting boons with peace but the other hand has a bow and arrow or any other weapon. I can be peaceful when I am strong when needed. Never lose your self respect in the name of yoga and spiritually.</span><br/><span>How can we be aware of something outside us?</span><br/><span>That is the fundamental difference between matter and consciousness. Matter is not aware of being aware. For example a tape recorder gives all the material that it has. But the tape recorder is not aware of itself. The essential thing about human being is that we are aware that we are human beings. The question of awareness is not like a mirror that reflects but like something from inside to outside. Mirror only shows what is there in front of it. Similarly, tape recorder only gives out what is in there. Self-awareness is what reflects the inside to outside. It can choose or it can reject. I can choose to take something or reject it. When we add spirituality to awareness, then we can get the positive things and reject the negative. If I can find awareness in myself then I can be aware of whatever I want.</span><br/><span>Practical session:</span><br/><span>We can go to some practices now.Lie down comfortably in shavasana. Join the legs together and hands on the sides of the body. Close your eyes. Tighten the toes and heels. Tighten the knee caps. Tighten the thighs and the waist. Exhale and tighten the stomach. Inhale and hold the breath. Turn the hands as fists and tighten the hands. Tighten right up to the shoulders. Continue to hold the breath. Tighten the neck, tighten the face… tighten….tighten…Relax… Exhale freely… Relax the whole body. Now let us do it one more time. This is how the awareness is gathered in the body. Slowly turn to the side and stand up. Close your eyes. Stay straight. Put your hands freely over the shoulders. Observe… Inhale and the exhale freely. Gently move the body from right to left and left to right. Give your weight to right foot and then to left foot. Then give your weight to the center again. This way the body is aware of its weight. Observe the weight equally distributed to both legs. Move the body to front and to back. The weight now goes to toes and to heels. Then move it to the middle. Observe your weight equally distributed to both legs. Both legs have equal awareness. Now let us improve the awareness in our right side. Inhale and raise the right hand slowly. Observe the stretching at the right side of the body. Exhale and bend to the right side of your body. Stretch the whole right side of the body. As you are stretching, observe the awareness on the right side of your body. Maintain the posture as long as 8-10 inhales. Relax and breathe freely. There is a smile on our faces. Slowly inhale and go up straight while the hand is up. As we go straight up, the stretching disappears on our right side. Now our right side is full of awareness more than our left side. Our right side is livelier. Stay in this awareness for as long as 8-10 respirations. Now let us do the same thing for our left side. Now both sides of my body have awareness and they are livelier. Release the arms freely from the shoulders. Inhale and exhale. Bend forward. Recognize the stretching in the thighs. Stretch the waist and the spinal cord. Bend down fully. Stretch the back of the body, and you will be aware of your pulse. Remain in this final posture for about 10-12 respirations. Slowly come back. Inhale. As you go up the stretch is released. The awareness continues to maintain. As we go up, the blood flows downwards. The head feels lighter. This way we have improved our awareness in our body. We have also developed a personal awareness. Slowly slide your hands up towards your waist. Push the elbows back. Exhale and inhale. Stretch your thighs as you go back. Stretch the neck completely. This exercise will improve the awareness in your front areas. Inhale and say “aum”. Slowly go back to normal and let the blood flow back to the brain. Relax. Now your whole body is full of awareness.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Raghuramji - The President of the 1st Yoga Festival - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Before we start the session, I would like to start with a brief meditation.</span><br/><span>I will give you the instructions:</span><br/><span>You may sit cross-legged.

What is wrong if we spend this energy in the form of sex, smoking etc.? What happens is that, they take away our restlessness when we are in contact with objects but it comes back to us soon as we are denied of the object, afterwards. The problem with these ways of spending the energy is that they make the mind much more restless. After involving in a gossip, you feel the relief first. But afterwards, you observe that your mind become much more complex. All these methods to spend that energy have evil attached. Spending this restless energy by hyperactivity is unhealthy. Gardening on the other hand is a wonderful way of spending this energy. But today we have so many concrete buildings that there are almost no gardens at all. In India, women knit while they wait for the bus at the bus stop. I am sure same way women do activities all over the world. That is a way wonderful way of spending their restless energy inside. I always wonder why women have such wonderful activities but not men. Therefore women always are knitting to conquer their restlessness where the men spend restlessness by smoking in India. Smoking is a problem for the health where as knitting is not. Another way people spend their restless energy is by eating. The whole bubblegum business survives on our restless. Probably the bubblegum business will be even better as we get more and more restless. That is how we spend that energy and become peaceful.</span><br/><span>In all these activities, we spend that energy but we do not address the basic issue as to how not to become restless inside again. This is a very important point. Spending the restless energy is important but how not to become restless is much more important. Essentially, yoga works in that area.</span><br/><span>The role of the yoga is to make you less restless inside. One of the most important key factors in yoga to control that restlessness is being aware. Being aware of yourself, you will be able to control your restlessness.</span><br/><span>There are two ways of looking at this awareness. There is a positive and negative awareness. One of the greatest thinkers of India is Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He used to tell a simple story to explain this awareness. There was a farm house in a land of 100 acres and there was a watchman for this house. This watchman used to travel around the farm and check if everything was all right. He was a very good watchman. He used to know all the details about the farm. If anything was missing in the farm, he would be aware of it. If there was a thief or an animal jumped into the farm, making a sound, he would be aware of that too. He would recognize any small sound. That is his job. He does this job only for the 8 hours that is his work hours. After that he becomes tired and he could not continue that awareness as a watchman for more than 8 hours. He would like to break off! If he does more than one day he becomes sick.</span><br/><span>And there is another person who also has awareness. His awareness is of different nature. He knows what things are available in the farm house. If there was a problem in the car, he could go into his garage and get the necessary equipment to fix it. If a guest comes, he knows in garden, which tree to pick the good fruits from. He is aware for 24 hours, and he is the owner of the farm house. Those 24 hours of awareness is not a burden on him. A watchman’s awareness is a burden after 8 hours; where as the owner’s awareness is not a burden for 24 hours. Watchman’s awareness is a pressure where as the owner’s awareness is a relief. What is the difference between the watchman’s awareness and the owner’s awareness? The watchman’s awareness is always the awareness of negativity. Watchman’s awareness is around what is wrong, where is the weakness, where the thief, etc can enter. The owner’s awareness is a positive awareness. Ramakrishna used to say that the watchman’s awareness is bad, but the owner’s awareness is good. Watchman’s awareness is a burden but the owner’s awareness is a relief. God sent you not as a watchman of your body but as the owners of your body. Ramakrishna therefore suggested don’t have watchman’s awareness on you, have owner’s awareness. A hyperactive person is generally thinking what is wrong. We are tutored to think that the more negativity we see, the more intelligent we are. We think that if we can find fault, we are great. While listening to music, when we see a small fault and point-out the mistake, we feel proud that we know about music. Education is making us more and more negative aware people.</span><br/><span>Yoga awareness is about positive awareness. If you become more and more negatively aware, then the world looks negative. It is very easy to see something that is negative. In a white sheet, we can immediately see a black spot. You do not need to put any effort to see that black dot. Mind very easily goes to that negative awareness. The closer you look at something, the more negative you see. This is how we get closer to hyperactivity and negative awareness. We have to develop consciously positive awareness.</span><br/><span>When you look at a rose garden, there are actually more thorns than roses. One flower at least has ten thorns. The more you look at these thorns you wonder why they call it the rose garden instead of the thorn garden. That is right according to the democratic ideas also. When you start negative awareness, it is like looking at the thorns instead of the roses. The more you look at the thorns; you may even start blaming the rose flower the more. Then you can say that the flower is having a conspiracy against you. The flower is attracting you and therefore the thorns can harm you. When you start looking at the negative, even the positive will appear negative to you and you feel you are really smart.</span><br/><span>On the other hand, the more you see the flowers, the more you appreciate the garden. If you look at the flowers, you may even appreciate the thorns. You may start saying that the thorn is beautifully placed there to protect the rose. Yoga tries to improve positive awareness. The first help of yoga to come out of hyperactivity is to learn to look at everything positively.</span><br/><span>Let us look at our daily life. What do you do first when you get up in the morning? You look at the clock. It is time that you have to get up. You have a lot of things to do. A horrible day has started again, you curse the day! But you can’t help it. You start the day with negativity! Yoga says, stop all these. Think about the positive things. Before you start any activity just spend 10-15 minutes thinking of the positive things. Then your day becomes positive.</span><br/><span>The practice of yoga gives a great advantage to you. When you stretch you body, your muscles excite hundreds of neurons in your brain. When you stretch the body, these neurons get activated. Activated neurons add to your awareness. By stretching your body, you are actually developing your awareness. Awareness is nothing but trying to build a harmony between the mind and the body. When you stretch your body in the yoga, use this awareness and look at the stretch positively. When you do that, your stretches will be able to take you to deeper levels of relaxation. Don’t worry about your pains or the bending that you can not do. Think about it positively and think you can do so much. That positive awareness will help you go to a positive relaxation.</span><br/><span>This relaxation will make you less restless. Try to do the practices of yoga slowly and gently. The positive awareness helps you to agree with self in just a moment. Stay in the final posture. Allow yourself to observe all the changes taken place in your body. Observe your blood flow and pulse rate. Listen to the vibes inside your body dispassionately. All these will help you to go to deeper relaxations. Thereby you are actually trying to reduce your inner hyperactivity. You will not lose your sensitivity meanwhile. Once you are peaceful inside, you can always bring in energy when an activity is needed.</span><br/><span>This is valid for the second category of people I have explained earlier namely the people who are basically very sensitive but they are not restless. They can do the activity calmly but they do not need to become hyperactive. They are aware of everything but they do not react. Actually you can do a set of exercises to see how aware you are inside. In Sanskrit the word pragna which is translated to English as “awareness”. There is no better word for it than awareness. Awareness is always object oriented. Awareness always has “of what?” Where as pragna is not object oriented, it is subject oriented. Pragna is a state inside, not a state from outside. We are aware of all the things around the world. We are aware of what is happening in America in India; we are aware of the politics today. We are aware of all these things but we are never aware of our inside. This is not pragna; it is awareness alright but not pragna.The practice we will do today is about how to bring bout that awareness from outside to inside. We will see how our blood flows and how our heart works. We will see how we can enter the sound resonance, and see the various impulses of the nerves. We will improve our awareness about all these activities. This is done basically by reducing the scattered and fragmented awareness out side. Finally we will eliminate all the things and we will become mere awareness. That mere awareness is what is called the pragna. Other objects, we have to show with the help of light. Even the moon can not be seen without the sun light. We don’t need another light to see self. Pragna is light itself. With the help of pragna, we can see other objects. Once we become pragna, then we can bring the pragna into all our actions. If you do this yoga practice 45 minutes a day you can become pragna yourself. Once you bring in pragna in all your activities, your activities will neither become dull or hyperactive. You will be wonderfully active and at the same time you will not be hyperactive. You will be the master of the activities; the activities will not be your masters. You are here and now. I can answer a few questions now.</span><br/><span>Question and answer session:</span><br/><span>What is the person when he is having this awareness?This question was asked by Arjuna to Krishna in the second chapter of Bhagavad-Gita. There he asks what a person is like in the state of pragna. To be aware of everything outside us, science helps us. Science does not have any prescription for inner awareness. Your self awareness is what the yoga alone can do. In this respect yoga is not against the science, it supports science.</span><br/><span>We are very much object- oriented. Do we have to spend some time alone and quiet?</span><br/><span>We are trained by the present day life style to live in object orientation. We have no opportunity to be in subject orientation. That is the way meditation practice is to be taken. This is essentially to be quiet and take this quietness into deeper inner layers of us.</span><br/><span>When there is a hyperactive person in front of me I try to be calm. When I am calm, he gets more hyperactive.</span><br/><span>A person in the state of awareness would never harm another person. A person who is aware could only help others to grow. If that person’s silence is going to help the other person, he will remain silence. If that person’s silence will make the other one even more hyperactive, he will be silent inside and will not allow his silence to exhibit outside which can harm other person. So he will show his emotion with out getting caught up in emotions so that the other person will mend himself. A person who has established a world of pragna can never harm the outside world. I would like to give an example from my son. He was very peaceful at school. His friends used to tease him and make fun of him. He would come home and cry. All the others have told him not to fight with those kids. But my son used to say that the quieter I am, the more they tease me. I told my son without loosing awareness to go and show his strength to them because he was strong enough. But do not keep any anger within you while doing this. The next day he went and just showed his strength to them. Afterwards they all became good friends of him. When I say be peaceful, I do not mean lose your self respect. You know our Indian gods. One of their hands is in the pose of granting boons with peace but the other hand has a bow and arrow or any other weapon. I can be peaceful when I am strong when needed. Never lose your self respect in the name of yoga and spiritually.</span><br/><span>How can we be aware of something outside us?</span><br/><span>That is the fundamental difference between matter and consciousness. Matter is not aware of being aware. For example a tape recorder gives all the material that it has. But the tape recorder is not aware of itself. The essential thing about human being is that we are aware that we are human beings. The question of awareness is not like a mirror that reflects but like something from inside to outside. Mirror only shows what is there in front of it. Similarly, tape recorder only gives out what is in there. Self-awareness is what reflects the inside to outside. It can choose or it can reject. I can choose to take something or reject it. When we add spirituality to awareness, then we can get the positive things and reject the negative. If I can find awareness in myself then I can be aware of whatever I want.</span><br/><span>Practical session:</span><br/><span>We can go to some practices now.Lie down comfortably in shavasana. Join the legs together and hands on the sides of the body. Close your eyes. Tighten the toes and heels. Tighten the knee caps. Tighten the thighs and the waist. Exhale and tighten the stomach. Inhale and hold the breath. Turn the hands as fists and tighten the hands. Tighten right up to the shoulders. Continue to hold the breath. Tighten the neck, tighten the face… tighten….tighten…Relax… Exhale freely… Relax the whole body. Now let us do it one more time. This is how the awareness is gathered in the body. Slowly turn to the side and stand up. Close your eyes. Stay straight. Put your hands freely over the shoulders. Observe… Inhale and the exhale freely. Gently move the body from right to left and left to right. Give your weight to right foot and then to left foot. Then give your weight to the center again. This way the body is aware of its weight. Observe the weight equally distributed to both legs. Move the body to front and to back. The weight now goes to toes and to heels. Then move it to the middle. Observe your weight equally distributed to both legs. Both legs have equal awareness. Now let us improve the awareness in our right side. Inhale and raise the right hand slowly. Observe the stretching at the right side of the body. Exhale and bend to the right side of your body. Stretch the whole right side of the body. As you are stretching, observe the awareness on the right side of your body. Maintain the posture as long as 8-10 inhales. Relax and breathe freely. There is a smile on our faces. Slowly inhale and go up straight while the hand is up. As we go straight up, the stretching disappears on our right side. Now our right side is full of awareness more than our left side. Our right side is livelier. Stay in this awareness for as long as 8-10 respirations. Now let us do the same thing for our left side. Now both sides of my body have awareness and they are livelier. Release the arms freely from the shoulders. Inhale and exhale. Bend forward. Recognize the stretching in the thighs. Stretch the waist and the spinal cord. Bend down fully. Stretch the back of the body, and you will be aware of your pulse. Remain in this final posture for about 10-12 respirations. Slowly come back. Inhale. As you go up the stretch is released. The awareness continues to maintain. As we go up, the blood flows downwards. The head feels lighter. This way we have improved our awareness in our body. We have also developed a personal awareness. Slowly slide your hands up towards your waist. Push the elbows back. Exhale and inhale. Stretch your thighs as you go back. Stretch the neck completely. This exercise will improve the awareness in your front areas. Inhale and say “aum”. Slowly go back to normal and let the blood flow back to the brain. Relax. Now your whole body is full of awareness.</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Talk on Hyperactivity","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2004-05-29T04:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":206,"uuid":"8a1656ae-45ef-4a7b-8300-e2fe34380273","title":"Talk on Yoga and Obesity","slug":"talk-on-yoga-and-obesity","markdown":"<p><span>Raghuramji - The President of the 1st Yoga Festival - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Nameste. Welcome to this session on yoga and obesity.</span><br/><span>Let me give you some ideas about the background of obesity and then we will do some practices. This year in United States of America, they declared that obesity is the number one national epidemic. They found that more than 32% of the young adults are obese.</span><br/><span>Obesity not only makes the body heavy and nonfunctional but it also makes the brain functioning come down. Because of obesity, when the blood has to reach every part of the body, it puts a very big burden on the heart. One of the most important reasons of heart attack is found to be obesity. Because the body is big, the blood has to circulate in the body but it can not reach the brain. Our glands in the body function better when there is no obesity.</span><br/><span>In addition to these, there are lots of social problems regarding obesity. There are families in which everyone is obese. Malnutrition is considered as better when compared with obesity. People consider obesity as only a body disease but it is a total personality problem. People consider burning the calories as a solution to obesity. Recently they found that is not the real solution. There is a reason why the body does not burn calories and you become obese. I work with patients in California suffering from eating disorders. The patients that I see are not just obese; they are several times the size of normal obese that normally we refer. They are so fat that you can not even make them burn the calories. Doing the fat burning exercises will give them hear problems or fractures. I have seen that there are specially designed cars for them to drive.</span><br/><span>All these patients’ problems start with the mind and emotions and percolate in their bodies. Our body is how our mind directs the body. Our body is how we use and abuse this body. Let us see how the obesity problem can occur starting spiritually.Our physical body is different from any other physical object like a table or a chair. In those physical objects, there is no life. But here there is life. Because of this, there are essentially three major differences between a dead physical body and our body. Any physical and inert body does not require food, but we constantly require food. The food should just be for nourishing but not for any other reason. While eating, we should eat in such a way that the food should be harmonized in our body. I have seen people, who eat food because they are bored and they do not know what to do. I have also seen people who are angry or emotionally upset. In order to get rid of this disturbed mental condition they go on eating. The first important thing about the food is, we should eat only when we are hungry. That is the harmony at the simplest level. In the nature, everything is in this harmony. You do not find a cat or a dog in the forest that is obese. They have plenty of things to eat but they don’t abuse their eating. They eat as much as their hunger permits. I was watching the Animal Channel on the television. A tiger after having a good meal was resting. There was a deer very close to him grazing. The tiger opened his eyes, looked at the deer, yarned and then closed his eyes continuing to rest again. Just because the deer was there, the tiger did not jump on the deer. He kept quiet because he was not hungry. The speaker said the tiger was not violent and he was full so he did not kill and eat the deer. He further said tigers are not violent they eat food if needed.</span><br/><span>So we should always think whether we eat food for the sake of hunger or because of many other reasons? But in order to think we need awareness. This awareness is absent, replaced by our desire to eat the moment we see food. That is one of the reasons why before eating we in India sit peacefully and say a simple prayer. Though we may not really think of the meaning or many times we may not know the meaning it helps us in bringing about our awareness. A simple prayer takes away your anger or your emotional disturbances and only pure hunger will be there. Let us just limit here to that fact that we should eat food only for the sake of hunger.</span><br/><span>The second equally important thing is fasting. People do fasting for so many other reasons. The fasting is very important to give rest to the stomach. The energy inside you is enough for you to survive even if you fast for 20 days. But we don’t even wait for twenty minutes. We should be able to develop a control over eating by fasting at least for one day or half a day in a week. If you fast for one day in a week, you will give your stomach a rest from a continuous activity. On the day of fasting, there are possibilities that you will become emotionally irritable. If you are able to do the fasting peacefully without getting irritable, then that fasting works like a therapy. That fasting will basically integrate with the whole body complex. There are several regulations given in Indian thinking for fasting. The word in Sanskrit for fasting is ‘UPAVAASA’ which means staying with oneself, (upa= near to oneself, and Vaasa= staying) it means not staying with food but to stay with self not needing food.</span><br/><span>Apart from the food, the other aspect at the physical level or body level is exercise. A physical inert body like a chair or table doesn’t need to do any exercise. Just keep it away for a couple of years and when you bring it back it will again be the same useful object for you. But on the other hand if you keep your body without working for even a month, it will lose its efficiency. When there is a fracture in your arm you immobilize it for 6 weeks, and then the arm becomes useless for some time. Our body needs to continuously do exercise. Our legs in this body are designed to walk for at least 5 miles every day. Our body is designed to sit down and get up naturally. Remember 50-60 years ago, in a place like India people used to walk so easily because the vehicles were not there in those days. In India, all the temples are made on the hills. People so easily used to go up the hill see the God and come back easily. It was a regular exercise without calling an exercise. Slowly we stopped doing those exercises. Now there are cars and we do not walk. There are elevators, and we do not climb the stairs. The worst thing is that we never sit on the floor like this squatting. As a result, our body has stopped doing all these activities. As a result, one day when you have to walk, you start gasping of breath.</span><br/><span>We continue to eat but we stop doing exercise. Naturally that food is converted into fat instead of muscles. That is why people get obese. Obesity is one of the results of this. The other problems could be all kinds of heart diseases. Then you rush to the doctor and the doctor makes you go through all the battery of tests and makes a report about you. Finally he will tell you that you don’t have any major problem. Actually you don’t have any problem. He will tell you to take some medicines for your non-existing problem and in addition he will advise you to go for a walk for 2 miles every day. For your health reasons, sit down and get up few times every day. These are what we should be doing naturally and we have given up. But now we need a doctor to come and tell us. Now it looks like a big activity for us to walk due to some heavy reason, but this was a natural activity for our grandfather.</span><br/><span>The other day I was going on a daily morning walk like any day and my friend appeared which is, his first day of walking. Immediately he was surprised to see me in the early morning and started with a smile and surprise, ‘oh, I thought you do yoga? You also have it…? How much is sugar? Is it under control; a flood of questions. Indicating people walk only if they have sugars and only on advice of a doctor.</span><br/><span>Lack of exercise is another way we have abused our own body. I have seen in USA particularly, a large number of population who go to work, come back and eat and then sit at home and watch TV and sleep. This is all they do. What will happen to that kind of a body but get to all these problems? Naturally our body needs exercise. There are essentially three different types of exercise we need to do. One is necessary for the healthy body. That should include bending, twisting, walking and jumping. These exercises are necessary for everybody. The second type of exercise has much more localized affects which are prescribed for an athlete. For example a tennis player has to do specific exercises that are local in the body muscles and are useful for his game. Each specific sport or game has specific combination of practices which are specially researched into and given.</span><br/><span>General types of exercises are associated with age. Until the age of 40-45 we need to do exercises regularly for keeping fit and building up. From 45 to 60 we should do stabilizing exercises. After 60, we should slowly go to relaxing exercises. Unless we have a health problem we should continue to do these exercises.</span><br/><span>Another important aspect of our body is relaxation. I have seen people giving a lot of importance to exercise but not enough for relaxation. In fact, the only way that people relax is just sleep. We never do conscious methods of relaxations. In a lot of obesity cases, the solution is not the exercise but together with it the relaxation. People have not paid much attention to this relaxation. Sleep gives a certain amount of relaxation no doubt but a conscious relaxation is much more important. If you do not have a good sleep, your relaxation is not that good. Sleep is not in our hands. Whether the sleep will be good or not is not in our control. If you take medicines for sleep that sleep is also not a relaxing sleep. To some extent we can control the sleep by doing exhausting exercises. You probably will get a good sleep after that. But it is very important to do conscious methods of relaxation. The importance of yoga is essentially to give us that conscious method of relaxation. The essential purpose of yoga is not to give exercise but to give a conscious method of relaxation. In seventies, Dr. Herbert Benson has made a research in this regard in America. He was a medical doctor from Harvard. His observation was that a good sleep can give up to 7% of rest in the body. Where as a conscious method of relaxation like yoga will give 17-18% of rest. That means that you can get twice to thee times as much rest by conscious relaxation in a shorter period of time compared to a good sleep. His hypothesis also answers why a conscious relaxation will give deeper rest. We have a sympathetic and a parasympathetic tone in our bodies. While in sleep, the sympathetic tone will not come down as much as in the conscious method of relaxation. A sleep will not bring down your sympathetic tone. It makes a little change but not very appreciable. Hypertension will not become normal by sleeping. One important disturbance for obesity is also sympathetic activity. Where as a conscious process of relaxation will help bring down the sympathetic tone. This is where yoga is very important. We have made many studies on how yoga can help bring down the sympathetic tone. One important experiment we have done is Yoga that we gave to the astronaut sent to space. I gave him classes on conscious methods of relaxation. One of the major problems of the people who go to the space was high sympathetic tones. Once he practiced yoga he could bring down this tone to normal levels by consciously relaxing. Later we received a request from the pilots in America saying they want to learn Yoga. The second experiment we have done was with the blind children. We introduced Yoga to a blind school with 70 children. After one month we saw that all the sympathetic parameters have gone down. I have to tell you why it was important with the blind children. What happens when you compare the blind children with the normal children is that the blind do not have eyes but the others have one important sensory organ called the eye. Children without eyes feel threatened in a world where everybody can see and they can’t. Because of that threat their sympathetic tone is always high. When you see something threatening, your sympathetic tone will go up. These children always feel threatened because they live in a world of people who can see. Therefore their sympathetic tones are high. In general their sympathetic tones are almost 15-18% higher than a normal person’s. With one month of practice of Yoga, their sympathetic tones have come down to such wonderful levels that their health also improved. Yoga has to be given essentially for the idea of relaxation. Once you are able to relax, the body becomes harmonious.</span><br/><span>There is a wonderful harmony between food and hunger in the case of people who are doing yoga. So it is not burning the calorie but harmonizing the calorie that is important. This much is enough about physical body level.</span><br/><span>Deep inside we have the life force personality behind the gross physical personality called Prana. This Prana is a subtle personality of us. When this Prana is slow we are healthy and when the Prana is fast, we are sick. The speed of Prana indicates the sickness condition within us. One of the manifestations of this speed in Prana is in the form of speed in respiration. When the speed of Prana manifests in digestive system we unnecessarily start feeling hungry. There are three ways that the speed of Prana manifests at the physiological level. The text called ‘yogavasista’ discussed about this. One of these ways is the indigestion. Because of that people do not feel hungry. As a result of it, they lose their weight. Another way is because of this speed of Prana people start developing wrong digestion. These are the people having problems of acidity and gastric diseases. The third type is over-digestion. This category of people develops obesity. Because of the restlessness of Prana, although they eat enough they still feel hungry. This hunger is not a real hunger but an illusion of hunger created because of the speed of Prana. A regular practice of Pranayama will bring down the speed of Prana.</span><br/><span>Essentially there are two techniques which will help us reduce the speed of Prana. One of them is doing the left nostril breathing. If you do 27 rounds of left nostril breathing in one sitting three times a day, it is stated that it will bring out a higher metabolism. That will help reduce the obesity on the body. The second method is to do the same thing with the other nostril. The third method is the diaphragm and abdominal breathing with the sound resonance of “aum”. With each exhalation do 9 times “aum”. The sound resonance of “aum” tries to harmonize the energies of the abdominal level.</span><br/><span>Since people are of different varieties, which can be classified broadly into three types we have three problems of digestion. Generally people who are very sensitive have usually wrong digestion problems and not obesity. People who are no only sensitive, but are shy and emotional are the ones who suffer from obesity.</span><br/><span>Let us go the mental personality now. The agitations of the mind, the restlessness of the mind can percolate into physiology creating obesity. What is more important is, the more subtle levels we go, the effect will also be more. The restfulness of the mind is very important on the process of digestion. That is the reason why the mental level, along with these exercise and practices of yoga asanas and pranayama; we must also do the practice of meditation. In meditation we try to make the mind peaceful. If you are not introduced into any specific methods of meditation, you can play some nice soft music and put your mind on the music. It should never be done for more than 20 minutes.</span><br/><span>The intellectual level is one of the important levels which can give us logical support for controlling obesity. If we can resolve the mental disturbances by roper understanding and logic we can control it before it percolates into our body level.</span><br/><span>Most of the cases of obesity are because these people are emotionally disturbed and upset. It is always suggested that we should have a positive attitude towards an obese person. We should be able to leave the problems aside and not think about them all the time.</span><br/><span>In developed countries one of the important problems is that people are too conscious about their bodies. Body is just a useful instrument. It is not everything. It is just an outer layer. Several times deeper and more intense is what we are. One of the aspects of Yoga is to be able to leave the body alone aside and go subtle inside the body level. The healthy body is the body that I can leave and come out of it. A healthy child is at body level only when he or she is hungry; most of the time the child is detached from body. Therefore a child is healthy when it does not give you too much of a problem. A healthy child does not require mother’s attention very much. When the child is sick he want the mother’s attention all the time. Similarly healthy body is the body that does not require much of your attention. Children are so wonderful because they are not attached at the body level, they think of their body only when they are hungry. Otherwise they are happy with their happiness inside. Just to give an example in our ashram a boy was playing with the other kids and while playing he fell down. He hurt his knee and blood was coming out. But he went on playing happily. His mother came and saw the wound said “oh you are hurt”. Then he looked at his knee and started crying. This means that it really did not give him pain. Only when he looked at it and brought about the consciousness of the body then it started to give him pain. If you are not in the body level, that indicates that you are healthy. I see so many people get so concerned about things at the body level like food, exercise etc. These are all necessary but it is to go beyond which is important. Good food good exercise good rest etc should help us to see how we can get out of the body level. Animals also do not stay at the body level. That is why they are very happy. A friend of mine is a medical doctor in Colorado USA. One day he was busy in a surgery. Suddenly he gets a phone call from vet’s office. They said his dog has come out of the house and is run over by a car. They said his legs were broken and they were fixing it. The doctor finished his work and went to see his dog. It took one hour for him to reach once he reached vets office and asked for his dog. The receptionist said they did surgery and everything was successful. He then asks where the dog is. They tell him that the dog will come to him when he hears his voice. And in two minutes the dog really walks to him. He was surprised at this because when he performs surgery on somebody he has to put them in ICU and special ward for a week, where as in dog’s case, one hour after the operation the dog can walk. How is this possible for the dog to get up so easily? The vet answered “people are so worried about their body that they stay in hospital. The dog is not worried about the body so he comes out immediately”. The practices of Yoga, exercises and relaxation are all important but essentially coming out of them is much more important. That is the reason why at the end of the Yoga practice you do the DRT and shavasana. That will help you come out of the body. The healthier the body is, the easier for you to do the shavasana. This is how the problem of obesity can be taken care of.</span><br/><span>Emotional aspect is another thing we need to pay attention to. Emotional disturbances can bring about obesity in a person. The feeling of not being accepted in the society can be an example. Then they start hating their own body.</span><br/><span>You are the closest person to your body. If you hate your body, nobody else can help your body. The most important emotional aspect in obesity is to befriend our body. We have worked with many patients by giving them the suggestion to respect their body as friend. Just because from time to time you can not discipline it, you don’t have to hate your body. According to Indian philosophy, the body is considered to be the temple of God and you are the divinity living inside. That is why we should try to feel close to the body and help the body to come out of this problem. </span><br/><span>Questions and Answers</span><br/><span>Some people can go to sleep immediately in shavasana. Does their sympathetic tone go high if they fall asleep? Why does it happen?</span><br/><span>There can be several reasons for falling asleep in shavasana. One of the reasons can be the habit of going to sleep the moment you are in horizontal position. Sympathetic tone will not go up but it will stop going down when you fall asleep. If somebody falls into sleep after shavasana, that sleep is even better than the normal sleep. It is better if they can overcome that sleep but they should not worry about it because that is a better quality of sleep. The reason is because we are so conditioned to sleep when we lie down. That habit makes us go to sleep. With a few practices of Yoga you can overcome that.</span><br/><span>Sometimes when somebody is in shavasana he doesn’t want to come back to body level again. Why is this?</span><br/><span>There could be two reasons for this and one of them is good where the other one is bad. The good reason is that he is in a very good and peaceful state and he does not want to come out of it. The other is being against going to the activity. The relaxation might develop hatred for activity. This is bad. A relaxation should not develop negativity for activity. A proper relaxation should not develop any negativity at all. A practice of Yoga can never develop negativity in you. If it brings about negativity for activity, then it is due to the quality of tamas or lethargy rather than a good relaxation. Lethargy brings about lack of awareness. You have to get rid of it by the actively participating in Yoga.</span><br/><span>Our body is provided with neurons. Whenever we stretch the body, it is said that these neurons get activated in the brain. That develops our awareness. What mechanism happens let us not worry about it but our experience is we develop awareness. Therefore it is not important how perfect you do the posture. What is important is how you develop your awareness through the stretch. You can not expect an obese to do good yoga postures. That is why the perfection of the posture is not important. The stretch, they do, bring about awareness and that is very good. The stretch should come from inside not from outside which means don’t stretch externally but let a person doing yoga stretch himself from within. Outside stretch may be useful for a small time. Some Yoga schools do such stretching activities. It could only be useful for an initial period. After that, the stretch should be developed from inside. That internal awareness is very important for relaxation. If the stretch comes from outside, and is not coming from inside the body develops a resisting tendency. Anything coming from outside, the body tries to resist and tries to fight it out. By providing an external stretch you actually try to develop a resisting tendency inside. Psychologically that is not a good thing for yoga. Essentially a person practicing yoga is free from all kinds of resisting forces inside. A resistance inside takes away the psychological flexibility. We should never encourage resisting forces to develop inside. That builds our irritability and arrogance. That is why the author of Hatha Yoga says, Yoga should never be done by force or pressure from outside. That is why in our Yoga schools the teacher does not come and bend you or force you and press you to do it. We allow people to do the postures with the effort from within. Out side is only to correct the positions.</span><br/><span>Is calling people to Yoga classes also a kind of force and pressure?</span><br/><span>That is right if the person is not a willing candidate for yoga. The moment there is a force from outside, there is always a reaction inside. We should convince them. At the beginning we give the practice from outside but slowly the practice should come from the depth. Interest to do yoga should come from within. What comes from inside, transforms you. If you force a person to become a better human being, he will be waiting for an opportunity to be bad. As a result there will be no transformation. That is why we have a beautiful prayer in the ideas of Yoga: “Let the raw fruit become a fruit from within”. Such a fruit, fruiting from inside will have wonderful fragrance, color and taste; similarly the person who transforms from inside spreads wonderful fragrances, colors and taste.</span><br/><span>Let us do some practice now. We will do some salutation and prayer. Afterwards we will do Shawasana followed by meditation.</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Raghuramji - The President of the 1st Yoga Festival - Istanbul / Turkey</span><br/><br/><span>Nameste. Welcome to this session on yoga and obesity.</span><br/><span>Let me give you some ideas about the background of obesity and then we will do some practices. This year in United States of America, they declared that obesity is the number one national epidemic. They found that more than 32% of the young adults are obese.</span><br/><span>Obesity not only makes the body heavy and nonfunctional but it also makes the brain functioning come down. Because of obesity, when the blood has to reach every part of the body, it puts a very big burden on the heart. One of the most important reasons of heart attack is found to be obesity. Because the body is big, the blood has to circulate in the body but it can not reach the brain. Our glands in the body function better when there is no obesity.</span><br/><span>In addition to these, there are lots of social problems regarding obesity. There are families in which everyone is obese. Malnutrition is considered as better when compared with obesity. People consider obesity as only a body disease but it is a total personality problem. People consider burning the calories as a solution to obesity. Recently they found that is not the real solution. There is a reason why the body does not burn calories and you become obese. I work with patients in California suffering from eating disorders. The patients that I see are not just obese; they are several times the size of normal obese that normally we refer. They are so fat that you can not even make them burn the calories. Doing the fat burning exercises will give them hear problems or fractures. I have seen that there are specially designed cars for them to drive.</span><br/><span>All these patients’ problems start with the mind and emotions and percolate in their bodies. Our body is how our mind directs the body. Our body is how we use and abuse this body. Let us see how the obesity problem can occur starting spiritually.Our physical body is different from any other physical object like a table or a chair. In those physical objects, there is no life. But here there is life. Because of this, there are essentially three major differences between a dead physical body and our body. Any physical and inert body does not require food, but we constantly require food. The food should just be for nourishing but not for any other reason. While eating, we should eat in such a way that the food should be harmonized in our body. I have seen people, who eat food because they are bored and they do not know what to do. I have also seen people who are angry or emotionally upset. In order to get rid of this disturbed mental condition they go on eating. The first important thing about the food is, we should eat only when we are hungry. That is the harmony at the simplest level. In the nature, everything is in this harmony. You do not find a cat or a dog in the forest that is obese. They have plenty of things to eat but they don’t abuse their eating. They eat as much as their hunger permits. I was watching the Animal Channel on the television. A tiger after having a good meal was resting. There was a deer very close to him grazing. The tiger opened his eyes, looked at the deer, yarned and then closed his eyes continuing to rest again. Just because the deer was there, the tiger did not jump on the deer. He kept quiet because he was not hungry. The speaker said the tiger was not violent and he was full so he did not kill and eat the deer. He further said tigers are not violent they eat food if needed.</span><br/><span>So we should always think whether we eat food for the sake of hunger or because of many other reasons? But in order to think we need awareness. This awareness is absent, replaced by our desire to eat the moment we see food. That is one of the reasons why before eating we in India sit peacefully and say a simple prayer. Though we may not really think of the meaning or many times we may not know the meaning it helps us in bringing about our awareness. A simple prayer takes away your anger or your emotional disturbances and only pure hunger will be there. Let us just limit here to that fact that we should eat food only for the sake of hunger.</span><br/><span>The second equally important thing is fasting. People do fasting for so many other reasons. The fasting is very important to give rest to the stomach. The energy inside you is enough for you to survive even if you fast for 20 days. But we don’t even wait for twenty minutes. We should be able to develop a control over eating by fasting at least for one day or half a day in a week. If you fast for one day in a week, you will give your stomach a rest from a continuous activity. On the day of fasting, there are possibilities that you will become emotionally irritable. If you are able to do the fasting peacefully without getting irritable, then that fasting works like a therapy. That fasting will basically integrate with the whole body complex. There are several regulations given in Indian thinking for fasting. The word in Sanskrit for fasting is ‘UPAVAASA’ which means staying with oneself, (upa= near to oneself, and Vaasa= staying) it means not staying with food but to stay with self not needing food.</span><br/><span>Apart from the food, the other aspect at the physical level or body level is exercise. A physical inert body like a chair or table doesn’t need to do any exercise. Just keep it away for a couple of years and when you bring it back it will again be the same useful object for you. But on the other hand if you keep your body without working for even a month, it will lose its efficiency. When there is a fracture in your arm you immobilize it for 6 weeks, and then the arm becomes useless for some time. Our body needs to continuously do exercise. Our legs in this body are designed to walk for at least 5 miles every day. Our body is designed to sit down and get up naturally. Remember 50-60 years ago, in a place like India people used to walk so easily because the vehicles were not there in those days. In India, all the temples are made on the hills. People so easily used to go up the hill see the God and come back easily. It was a regular exercise without calling an exercise. Slowly we stopped doing those exercises. Now there are cars and we do not walk. There are elevators, and we do not climb the stairs. The worst thing is that we never sit on the floor like this squatting. As a result, our body has stopped doing all these activities. As a result, one day when you have to walk, you start gasping of breath.</span><br/><span>We continue to eat but we stop doing exercise. Naturally that food is converted into fat instead of muscles. That is why people get obese. Obesity is one of the results of this. The other problems could be all kinds of heart diseases. Then you rush to the doctor and the doctor makes you go through all the battery of tests and makes a report about you. Finally he will tell you that you don’t have any major problem. Actually you don’t have any problem. He will tell you to take some medicines for your non-existing problem and in addition he will advise you to go for a walk for 2 miles every day. For your health reasons, sit down and get up few times every day. These are what we should be doing naturally and we have given up. But now we need a doctor to come and tell us. Now it looks like a big activity for us to walk due to some heavy reason, but this was a natural activity for our grandfather.</span><br/><span>The other day I was going on a daily morning walk like any day and my friend appeared which is, his first day of walking. Immediately he was surprised to see me in the early morning and started with a smile and surprise, ‘oh, I thought you do yoga? You also have it…? How much is sugar? Is it under control; a flood of questions. Indicating people walk only if they have sugars and only on advice of a doctor.</span><br/><span>Lack of exercise is another way we have abused our own body. I have seen in USA particularly, a large number of population who go to work, come back and eat and then sit at home and watch TV and sleep. This is all they do. What will happen to that kind of a body but get to all these problems? Naturally our body needs exercise. There are essentially three different types of exercise we need to do. One is necessary for the healthy body. That should include bending, twisting, walking and jumping. These exercises are necessary for everybody. The second type of exercise has much more localized affects which are prescribed for an athlete. For example a tennis player has to do specific exercises that are local in the body muscles and are useful for his game. Each specific sport or game has specific combination of practices which are specially researched into and given.</span><br/><span>General types of exercises are associated with age. Until the age of 40-45 we need to do exercises regularly for keeping fit and building up. From 45 to 60 we should do stabilizing exercises. After 60, we should slowly go to relaxing exercises. Unless we have a health problem we should continue to do these exercises.</span><br/><span>Another important aspect of our body is relaxation. I have seen people giving a lot of importance to exercise but not enough for relaxation. In fact, the only way that people relax is just sleep. We never do conscious methods of relaxations. In a lot of obesity cases, the solution is not the exercise but together with it the relaxation. People have not paid much attention to this relaxation. Sleep gives a certain amount of relaxation no doubt but a conscious relaxation is much more important. If you do not have a good sleep, your relaxation is not that good. Sleep is not in our hands. Whether the sleep will be good or not is not in our control. If you take medicines for sleep that sleep is also not a relaxing sleep. To some extent we can control the sleep by doing exhausting exercises. You probably will get a good sleep after that. But it is very important to do conscious methods of relaxation. The importance of yoga is essentially to give us that conscious method of relaxation. The essential purpose of yoga is not to give exercise but to give a conscious method of relaxation. In seventies, Dr. Herbert Benson has made a research in this regard in America. He was a medical doctor from Harvard. His observation was that a good sleep can give up to 7% of rest in the body. Where as a conscious method of relaxation like yoga will give 17-18% of rest. That means that you can get twice to thee times as much rest by conscious relaxation in a shorter period of time compared to a good sleep. His hypothesis also answers why a conscious relaxation will give deeper rest. We have a sympathetic and a parasympathetic tone in our bodies. While in sleep, the sympathetic tone will not come down as much as in the conscious method of relaxation. A sleep will not bring down your sympathetic tone. It makes a little change but not very appreciable. Hypertension will not become normal by sleeping. One important disturbance for obesity is also sympathetic activity. Where as a conscious process of relaxation will help bring down the sympathetic tone. This is where yoga is very important. We have made many studies on how yoga can help bring down the sympathetic tone. One important experiment we have done is Yoga that we gave to the astronaut sent to space. I gave him classes on conscious methods of relaxation. One of the major problems of the people who go to the space was high sympathetic tones. Once he practiced yoga he could bring down this tone to normal levels by consciously relaxing. Later we received a request from the pilots in America saying they want to learn Yoga. The second experiment we have done was with the blind children. We introduced Yoga to a blind school with 70 children. After one month we saw that all the sympathetic parameters have gone down. I have to tell you why it was important with the blind children. What happens when you compare the blind children with the normal children is that the blind do not have eyes but the others have one important sensory organ called the eye. Children without eyes feel threatened in a world where everybody can see and they can’t. Because of that threat their sympathetic tone is always high. When you see something threatening, your sympathetic tone will go up. These children always feel threatened because they live in a world of people who can see. Therefore their sympathetic tones are high. In general their sympathetic tones are almost 15-18% higher than a normal person’s. With one month of practice of Yoga, their sympathetic tones have come down to such wonderful levels that their health also improved. Yoga has to be given essentially for the idea of relaxation. Once you are able to relax, the body becomes harmonious.</span><br/><span>There is a wonderful harmony between food and hunger in the case of people who are doing yoga. So it is not burning the calorie but harmonizing the calorie that is important. This much is enough about physical body level.</span><br/><span>Deep inside we have the life force personality behind the gross physical personality called Prana. This Prana is a subtle personality of us. When this Prana is slow we are healthy and when the Prana is fast, we are sick. The speed of Prana indicates the sickness condition within us. One of the manifestations of this speed in Prana is in the form of speed in respiration. When the speed of Prana manifests in digestive system we unnecessarily start feeling hungry. There are three ways that the speed of Prana manifests at the physiological level. The text called ‘yogavasista’ discussed about this. One of these ways is the indigestion. Because of that people do not feel hungry. As a result of it, they lose their weight. Another way is because of this speed of Prana people start developing wrong digestion. These are the people having problems of acidity and gastric diseases. The third type is over-digestion. This category of people develops obesity. Because of the restlessness of Prana, although they eat enough they still feel hungry. This hunger is not a real hunger but an illusion of hunger created because of the speed of Prana. A regular practice of Pranayama will bring down the speed of Prana.</span><br/><span>Essentially there are two techniques which will help us reduce the speed of Prana. One of them is doing the left nostril breathing. If you do 27 rounds of left nostril breathing in one sitting three times a day, it is stated that it will bring out a higher metabolism. That will help reduce the obesity on the body. The second method is to do the same thing with the other nostril. The third method is the diaphragm and abdominal breathing with the sound resonance of “aum”. With each exhalation do 9 times “aum”. The sound resonance of “aum” tries to harmonize the energies of the abdominal level.</span><br/><span>Since people are of different varieties, which can be classified broadly into three types we have three problems of digestion. Generally people who are very sensitive have usually wrong digestion problems and not obesity. People who are no only sensitive, but are shy and emotional are the ones who suffer from obesity.</span><br/><span>Let us go the mental personality now. The agitations of the mind, the restlessness of the mind can percolate into physiology creating obesity. What is more important is, the more subtle levels we go, the effect will also be more. The restfulness of the mind is very important on the process of digestion. That is the reason why the mental level, along with these exercise and practices of yoga asanas and pranayama; we must also do the practice of meditation. In meditation we try to make the mind peaceful. If you are not introduced into any specific methods of meditation, you can play some nice soft music and put your mind on the music. It should never be done for more than 20 minutes.</span><br/><span>The intellectual level is one of the important levels which can give us logical support for controlling obesity. If we can resolve the mental disturbances by roper understanding and logic we can control it before it percolates into our body level.</span><br/><span>Most of the cases of obesity are because these people are emotionally disturbed and upset. It is always suggested that we should have a positive attitude towards an obese person. We should be able to leave the problems aside and not think about them all the time.</span><br/><span>In developed countries one of the important problems is that people are too conscious about their bodies. Body is just a useful instrument. It is not everything. It is just an outer layer. Several times deeper and more intense is what we are. One of the aspects of Yoga is to be able to leave the body alone aside and go subtle inside the body level. The healthy body is the body that I can leave and come out of it. A healthy child is at body level only when he or she is hungry; most of the time the child is detached from body. Therefore a child is healthy when it does not give you too much of a problem. A healthy child does not require mother’s attention very much. When the child is sick he want the mother’s attention all the time. Similarly healthy body is the body that does not require much of your attention. Children are so wonderful because they are not attached at the body level, they think of their body only when they are hungry. Otherwise they are happy with their happiness inside. Just to give an example in our ashram a boy was playing with the other kids and while playing he fell down. He hurt his knee and blood was coming out. But he went on playing happily. His mother came and saw the wound said “oh you are hurt”. Then he looked at his knee and started crying. This means that it really did not give him pain. Only when he looked at it and brought about the consciousness of the body then it started to give him pain. If you are not in the body level, that indicates that you are healthy. I see so many people get so concerned about things at the body level like food, exercise etc. These are all necessary but it is to go beyond which is important. Good food good exercise good rest etc should help us to see how we can get out of the body level. Animals also do not stay at the body level. That is why they are very happy. A friend of mine is a medical doctor in Colorado USA. One day he was busy in a surgery. Suddenly he gets a phone call from vet’s office. They said his dog has come out of the house and is run over by a car. They said his legs were broken and they were fixing it. The doctor finished his work and went to see his dog. It took one hour for him to reach once he reached vets office and asked for his dog. The receptionist said they did surgery and everything was successful. He then asks where the dog is.

He was surprised at this because when he performs surgery on somebody he has to put them in ICU and special ward for a week, where as in dog’s case, one hour after the operation the dog can walk. How is this possible for the dog to get up so easily? The vet answered “people are so worried about their body that they stay in hospital. The dog is not worried about the body so he comes out immediately”. The practices of Yoga, exercises and relaxation are all important but essentially coming out of them is much more important. That is the reason why at the end of the Yoga practice you do the DRT and shavasana. That will help you come out of the body. The healthier the body is, the easier for you to do the shavasana. This is how the problem of obesity can be taken care of.</span><br/><span>Emotional aspect is another thing we need to pay attention to. Emotional disturbances can bring about obesity in a person. The feeling of not being accepted in the society can be an example. Then they start hating their own body.</span><br/><span>You are the closest person to your body.

In fact yoga entered space several years ago when Rakhesh sharma the Indian astronaut, talked to Indira Gandhi the then prime minister of India, from space saying he is practicing yoga on the space ship. Though it is becoming popular today in the world, it was a part of daily life, at least for some people of India through out the centuries as can be seen from the ancient texts. Time and again the reference comes in the writings for all these years. It appears that we dont have to take the trouble of redefining the term yoga but it is necessary that we understand in its true sense and like the way the sages have expressed with reference to the context. If we have to define it differently then we need to establish what was wrong in their definition and how a modified definition will help us for our growth and development.Understanding yoga becomes necessary because today when you go to the market ( earlier it used to be taught in the Ashramas but today we can find yoga being advertised, franchised and marketed in yoga studios.) we find different things being practiced in the name of yoga. There are patented names for yoga according to the masters, some times giving their names and some times giving some catchy names and marketable names. But the moment we call it yoga it has to mean some thing specific. That should be the minimum respect and justice we do to the ancient yoga masters. In this context we need to look into the various texts for information. The earliest text is the Upanishads, which are part of the Vedas, second being the Ramayana or supposed to be its part Yoga Vasista one of the oldest texts ( though original Valmiki Ramayana has not made mention of it), next comes Mahabharata or its part, the Bhagavad-Gita, more scientific presentation the Yoga Sutras of sage Patanjali, and the latest of the yoga texts called the Hata pradipika while taking these texts I shall try to give few of the definitions as giving all the definitions is not possible for our purposes.While describing the origin of this knowledge in Gita, Adi Shankaracharya said, that this knowledge is given by Lord Vishnu at the time of creation itself. The acharya (teacher) of Hatha pradipika says yoga is given by shankara at the time of creation to Parvathy. Though the names of who has given to who may be different and may appear like mythological the note worthy fact is that this knowledge is a very ancient, and is available at the time of creation itself!In Sanskrit every word has the root letter from which the word is derived. Accordingly the root letter for Yoga is yuj, which suggests joining, or bringing together two things the jeeva atma and the param atma. In a practical sense it means if we can create that kind of body-mind-consciousness complex of us that we could easily blend us with the universe around us in all kinds of situations peacefully without any disturbance that is yoga; jeevatma being the body mind complex of an individual and param atma is the god in the form of manifested world around us.Upanishad says yoga is sthiraam indriya dharanaam, holding the senses (external organas and internal organs) steady is yoga. Yoga Vasista is the text which gives the dialogue between Vasista and Rama, Vasista explaining to the latter about the philosophy of yoga so it is known as yoga Vasista. Naturally the definition for yoga given by Vasista is important. Here yoga is said to be the trick for calming the mind. manh prashamanopaayah yoga iti abhidheeyate.Bhagavad-Gita is an important text in this context, because of which at the end of every chapter we express this is taken from this text which is the Upanishad knowledge, Brahma vidya- the knowledge of ultimate reality, the science of yoga and is the discussion between Krishna and Arjunaetc. every chapter in this is called as yoga and it presents the idea of yoga in ever so many ways. In this yoga is defines as Samatvam yoga ucchate- yoga is the state of equanimity. Gita also describes the state of yoga as samaadhu acala buddhih tatha yogam avapsyasi. When the mind is kept in the state of tranquility, then it is has achieved the state of yoga. Yogis mind is like the steady flame which is protected from wind, yatha deepo nivatastho..yogino yata chittasya.. Sage Patanjali who has put the ideas of yoga from all the ancient wisdom writes the crisp definition of yoga in his sutras of yoga which is the text on yoga. In his second sutra Patanjali says, yoga is to arrest the disturbances of the mind, yogah chitta vrutti nirodhah. And in the next sutra he gives it a person who controls the mind will establish himself in the state of self, tathaa drastuh swarupe avasthanam since the disturbances identify us else where, vritti saarupyam itaratrah.From all these definitions it can be seen that there is consistency in the thinking of yoga from the time of Vedas and Upanishads up the time of Patanjali which in Sanskrit is called as ekavakyata. Yoga is a methodology to achieve and also a state of peace of mind, tranquility and harmony in all circumstances.This gives rise to several questions such as, why do we need to calm the mind, what is the advantage, why doing postures, manipulating breathing are called as yoga, what has body or breath got to do with mind. All these questions we will look into in future discussions.</span><br/><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>To day all over the globe one of the most important topics being discussed every where, is yoga. In fact yoga entered space several years ago when Rakhesh sharma the Indian astronaut, talked to Indira Gandhi the then prime minister of India, from space saying he is practicing yoga on the space ship. Though it is becoming popular today in the world, it was a part of daily life, at least for some people of India through out the centuries as can be seen from the ancient texts. Time and again the reference comes in the writings for all these years. It appears that we dont have to take the trouble of redefining the term yoga but it is necessary that we understand in its true sense and like the way the sages have expressed with reference to the context. If we have to define it differently then we need to establish what was wrong in their definition and how a modified definition will help us for our growth and development.Understanding yoga becomes necessary because today when you go to the market ( earlier it used to be taught in the Ashramas but today we can find yoga being advertised, franchised and marketed in yoga studios.) we find different things being practiced in the name of yoga. There are patented names for yoga according to the masters, some times giving their names and some times giving some catchy names and marketable names. But the moment we call it yoga it has to mean some thing specific. That should be the minimum respect and justice we do to the ancient yoga masters. In this context we need to look into the various texts for information. The earliest text is the Upanishads, which are part of the Vedas, second being the Ramayana or supposed to be its part Yoga Vasista one of the oldest texts ( though original Valmiki Ramayana has not made mention of it), next comes Mahabharata or its part, the Bhagavad-Gita, more scientific presentation the Yoga Sutras of sage Patanjali, and the latest of the yoga texts called the Hata pradipika while taking these texts I shall try to give few of the definitions as giving all the definitions is not possible for our purposes.While describing the origin of this knowledge in Gita, Adi Shankaracharya said, that this knowledge is given by Lord Vishnu at the time of creation itself. The acharya (teacher) of Hatha pradipika says yoga is given by shankara at the time of creation to Parvathy. Though the names of who has given to who may be different and may appear like mythological the note worthy fact is that this knowledge is a very ancient, and is available at the time of creation itself!In Sanskrit every word has the root letter from which the word is derived.

Let us do this simple exercise. Sit still peacefully; not rigid but with ease and suppleness. Close your eyes and observe breathing. Observe in-breath and out-breath at the tip of the nostril. Continue to observe, don&rsquo;t interfere with it. Let it be more and more gentle and soft and you continue to notice! Do not worry about any ratios, and don&rsquo;t worry about which lobe (part) of lung you are working for your breathing and all that. Don&rsquo;t even think of uniformity in breathing. No other consideration at all except watching the breath at the tip of the nostril for some time, say three to four minutes.Then slowly along with the inhaling breath, go from the tip of the nostril up to the throat. Now watch the sensations at the throat. Don&rsquo;t interfere with any of the sensations. Continue to notice the feeling of the breath at the throat for another three to four minutes. Continue with closed eyes and continue with total absorption. From the throat proceed to the depth of lungs along with the in-breath. The whole passage of breathing is relaxed and wide open naturally. You can notice hardly any friction and sensation in the whole passage of breathing right from the nostril up to the death of your lungs. It is the friction in the wind pipe which is responsible for the feeling of exhaustion. So this provides an opportunity to withdraw from the nasal passage as you breathe and you can feel the movement of lung muscles for your breathing. You can also observe that there is no obstruction between the air inside and the air outside. The inside air is called as breath and the air outside is called as air. You are in between! Do not take note of any wanderings of the mind, just ignore. Let the whole body continue to be relaxed. You become nothing but breathing. Once you have the experience of becoming yourself breathing, slowly and peacefully notice that you are not the breathing but the lung movement, which enables the breathing to manifest. You will be surprised with direct experience of being the Prana (kind of force) which is responsible for breathing and breathing is only consequential. Breathing is the result but actually, you are that which is behind the lung muscles. Make that Prana force goes on by itself without your interference. Prana the life force is going on its own. You are a witness of it.In the next step, after recognizing the movement of lungs going on spontaneously, notice the gap between exhalation and inhalation. Lung muscles come to a temporary halt. This is a very pleasant state where you are not doing any thing including moving the lung muscles. That you notice as the most restful state. As you go on identifying with that state, you start experiencing that the movement of lung muscles is going on out side of you and you are the stillness, non-active state in between the movement.You are one without any physical movement of lungs at all. That is when you can slowly transcend the Pranamaya Kộsa. (Once you are able to transcend the Prana or movement at respiratory level you can have the experience of transcending at other parts of the body in other activities. You are not breathing yet breathing is going on. You can same way transcend the limbs and walking is going on. You are not talking but talking is going on and so on).After transcending the Pranamaya kosa we come to identify with the manomaya kosa. Pranamaya kosa is left behind. The disturbances now in the form of thoughts belong to manomaya kosa. Ignore the thoughts and merge the mind in Aum chanting, by chanting Aum three times leisurely while you exhale; three fourth of exhalation say Aum and last fourth silence. Observe that all the thoughts of the mind merge into Aum and finally Aum merges into silence. Stay in that silence and thus transcend the manomaya kosa and further on to merge in silence.Stay for a period of ten to fifteen minutes and finally come out of meditation with the chanting of AUM. Percolate the peace through out the being and before opening the eyes, after rubbing the palms against each other, palm the eyes with warm palms and massage the eyes and face gently.Do this repeatedly for a few days so that you start experiencing the effect of the meditation.</span><br/><span>Aum Shantih Shantih, shanthihi.</span><br/><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>The Pranamaya level of being is fine but we need to go beyond to subtler levels.

Tot yoga. Power yoga. Disco yoga. Yoga Kickboxing. Fat-blasting yoga. Years after the ancient Eastern discipline caught on big in the United States, yoga is proving to have a suitably limber foothold here. Not only are more people taking up yoga, but it is being geared for American tastes. There is yoga for dieters, for jocks, even for new moms and their babies. &ldquo;Yoga is evolving to meet cultural needs,&rdquo; said Yoga Alliance president Hansa Knox Johnson. &ldquo;We have people who have different kinds of energies. Some of them are go-go, some are kind of more restless, some are more heavy, sedentary. So different yogas are appropriate for different kinds of people.&rdquo; Yoga has been gaining steam in this country for years. A study released last summer by the magazine Yoga Journal said about 15 million people in the United States practiced yoga — a 29 percent jump from the previous year. The yoga boom probably peaked a year ago, according to The Yoga Research and Education Center, but researchers there still expect interest to remain at higher levels. Yoga has benefited from the same baby boomer-fueled fitness trend that fills kickboxing classes and aerobics studios. But increased interest in alternative health practices has helped too. Yoga is often championed as a way to bring peace of mind in a jangly world. &ldquo;Our biggest spike in enrollment came right after 9-11,&rdquo; said Deborah Foss, executive director of the Albany Kripalu Yoga Center. &ldquo;I think people were so stressed out, they were looking for a place to calm down.&rdquo; Relatively few Americans had immersed themselves in the 5,000-year-old discipline when Foss took her first yoga class in 1989. In the years since, a lot of people have been attracted to aspects of yoga: the postures, the controlled breathing, the meditation and the aim of uniting mind, body and spirit. Today, yoga reaches all sort of demographics, from football players to school children to prisoners. And with more people taking up yoga, more styles of classes cropped up. Are you athletic? Power yoga might work. Don&rsquo;t mind a good, purifying sweat? Bikram Yoga, sometimes called hot yoga, is typically performed in rooms heated to around 100 degrees. Pregnant? Aqua yoga can make movement easier. Foss favors Kripalu Yoga, which she teaches under soft lights with slow stretches and sweet incantations of &ldquo;Ommm.&rdquo; But the center offers classes that run the spectrum in terms of physical demands. Some latter-day yoga offshoots would seem alien to a practitioner from 5,000 years ago, particularly those who focus on the quest for a better body. Some purists sniff at the likes of &ldquo;yoga for kickboxing&rdquo; and trendy yoga wear like &ldquo;Om earrings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yoga chick&rdquo; tops with Buddha prints. The fear is that turning yoga into a commodity or merely a physical training tool can obscure its higher purpose. &ldquo;The whole thing is to integrate your body, mind and spirit,&rdquo; Foss said. &ldquo;When we Westernize everything — and the culture is so built upon competition and big, better, more — sometimes we lose the essence of the practice.&rdquo; But Foss also notes &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not one right path.&rdquo; Foss and some other yoga veterans view it this way: While being able to put your leg behind your head is not the ultimate goal of yoga, many forms of it can lead practitioners to other dimensions of yoga. &ldquo;Yoga has been around for 5,000 years, and this is just a wave. And if it brings more people to the practice of yoga and they discover yoga&rsquo;s deeper dimensions, then it&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; said Trisha Lamb Feuerstein, director of research for the Yoga Education and Research Center. Then there&rsquo;s what Feuerstein calls &ldquo;yoga hybrids and mutants.&rdquo; She found &ldquo;Yogilates&rdquo; (a blend of yoga and Pilates); Yo-Chi (yoga plus T'ai Chi); Boga (boxing and yoga); and Smoga (yoga for smokers). Some of these hyphenated yogas test the patience of even inclusive sorts like Johnson. Yoga has its own philosophy, as do other serious disciplines, and mixing them isn&rsquo;t always a good thing, she said. With the proliferation of so many flavors of yoga, Johnson foresees a new backlash-driven focus on classic yoga. But she also believes yoga will continue to adapt. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really the ideal of yoga,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for all of this to coexist peacefully.&rdquo; &ldquo;When we Westernize everything — and the culture is so built upon competition and big, better, more — sometimes we lose the essence of the practice.&rdquo; Deborah Foss, Albany Kripalu Yoga Center</span><br/><br/><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Hot yoga. Tot yoga. Power yoga. Disco yoga. Yoga Kickboxing. Fat-blasting yoga. Years after the ancient Eastern discipline caught on big in the United States, yoga is proving to have a suitably limber foothold here. Not only are more people taking up yoga, but it is being geared for American tastes. There is yoga for dieters, for jocks, even for new moms and their babies. &ldquo;Yoga is evolving to meet cultural needs,&rdquo; said Yoga Alliance president Hansa Knox Johnson. &ldquo;We have people who have different kinds of energies. Some of them are go-go, some are kind of more restless, some are more heavy, sedentary. So different yogas are appropriate for different kinds of people.&rdquo; Yoga has been gaining steam in this country for years. A study released last summer by the magazine Yoga Journal said about 15 million people in the United States practiced yoga — a 29 percent jump from the previous year. The yoga boom probably peaked a year ago, according to The Yoga Research and Education Center, but researchers there still expect interest to remain at higher levels. Yoga has benefited from the same baby boomer-fueled fitness trend that fills kickboxing classes and aerobics studios. But increased interest in alternative health practices has helped too. Yoga is often championed as a way to bring peace of mind in a jangly world. &ldquo;Our biggest spike in enrollment came right after 9-11,&rdquo; said Deborah Foss, executive director of the Albany Kripalu Yoga Center. &ldquo;I think people were so stressed out, they were looking for a place to calm down.&rdquo; Relatively few Americans had immersed themselves in the 5,000-year-old discipline when Foss took her first yoga class in 1989.

Let us see what the rishis have to say about it. In Taittariya Upanishad the rishi says,tasmadva etasmaat anna rasamayaat, anyontara aatma pranamayah, te naisha purnah. Deeper or subtler or more essential than this (food or biological) self is the self in the form of prana. He is more complete than the food self. This is explained by Adi Shankaracharya in his commentary on Taittariya Upanishad as follows. The biological body is filled with the prana having the same shape as the biological body. The subtle body is more complete than the gross one.Further the Upanishad says, Pranam deva anu prananti, manushyah pashavascaye, which means that the forces like fire, etc (devah) depend on prana for their activity. This indicates that various types of forces within us have their activities based on prana. When the sage said, biological body is supported by the prana-body at subtler level, he meant that, the biological body and the biological forces alone may not decide, how much to spend for a certain activity. More of it is spent if this prana draws more of this energy and less and less energy is spent. So the performance of the other energies depends on prana. Therefore prana is more fundamental. This is what we have seen in the other examples how a person spends more energy than the other in doing the same amount of out put. But this prana depends on the mental body (Manomaya Kosa). This is the next observation. How can we relate the statement made by Upanishad sage? Let us try to understand the mental body. Our mental body desires to do some thing which may be a perceivable thought or may be non-perceivable idea which may be arising out of mind or mental personality. Prana has greater freedom than biological body or the freedom which we see in biological body is essentially due to the presence of Pranic body. Mind has power or authority over the prana because of which mind works its way through prana on body. When I desire to move my hand I let my mind influence prana which in turn moves the corresponding energy and the hand moves. We do not see all these things happening because we have such a speed between thinking and doing that we do not notice the gap.Subtler than biophysical body is prana, and when this prana becomes softer gentler and subtler it is mind. This prana is the cause for life. This prana is life. pranohi yasmat bhutanaam aayuh jeevanam, yaavat asmin shareere praano vassati taavat aayuh. As long as there is prana in the body, so long there is life. By relaxing the physical body or by experiencing the feeling of satisfaction at the body level one can go to prana level recognition. All those practices that we do at bio-physical body level are essentially to facilitate us to detach from the bio-physical level. Once when we detach and go to unconscious level it is sleep. But if we maintain consciousness and feel satisfied totally at bio-physical level we transcend to prana level, which is the cognition of only a gentle activity at a minimum level going on. Prana itself can not be perceived but its effect in the form of respiration or pulse or some other sensation goes on.From Prasna Upanishad what are the ideas of prana let us find out. In Prasna Upanishad it is said that like the spokes of the wheel holding the wheel taking all the burden of the wheel transmitting on the stationary axle, prana is one thing on which every thing in this universe is fixed. It is the prana which burns like fire, shines like the sun, rains like clouds, the wind, the earth and the moon. It is both form and formless! Prana is born out of Atma, the I as a shadow is born out of an object by the actions of the mind and has subdivided into five functions.</span><br/><span>Prana cakshusrotra mukha nasikabhyam Aditya</span><br/><span>sun</span><br/><span>Eyes, ears, nose and face</span><br/><span>Apana paayupasthe pruthivyam</span><br/><span>earth</span><br/><span>Genitals and anal track</span><br/><span>Vyana naadenaam vaayuh</span><br/><span>air</span><br/><span>Nervous system</span><br/><span>Udana urdhvam udaanat tejas</span><br/><span>light</span><br/><span>Upward activity</span><br/><span>Samaana swayam pratishte madhye Akaashah</span><br/><span>space</span><br/><span>In the middle portion of body</span><br/><span>Further it is described that prana with udana together with jeevatma (individual soul) is lead to the sankalpa loka (the will-domain). All these subtle elements and their subtle aspects, what can be seen and heard etc, mind and thoughts, ego and its objects, every thing rests in the state of sleep like birds in their nests.This is an interesting statement from the point of rebirth! Our memory is some thing which not only belongs to this body. Body undergoes changes every moment. Therefore body also means this moment, because this body is constantly undergoing changes. Memory belongs therefore to our past and future. This is important because memory connects us to future and past. Our memory is the one which carries us to the future. In other words our memory transcends this body. It carries the impressions in subtle layers deep within us and brings up from this subtle level when ever it is required. The above sutra tells us that this memory can go beyond this body along with Udana carrying the impressions into other world called Sankalpa loka. When this body is left by our soul or self, these Sankalpa desires also follow our soul but do not have an instrument called body in order to manifest in the form of activities. That is the bondage we have from the birth. In order to fulfill our deep rooted Sankalpa desires we will be doing several activities which in turn bring about newer desires. Thus the bondage continues.An anecdote which has some element of humor I would like to share. It was my very early job in a government organization, and I was still my probation period. I was very junior and I had a super boss who was a superintending engineer wanting to become chief engineer. His desire was so strong that if he comes across any temple he would go in to pray to god make me chief engineer. He would see any sadhu sit with him ask when he would become chief engineer. He became like a great joke in the office. One day I came a little late to the office and as soon as I entered lift I found this man alone in the lift. I greeted him good morning, and the lift started moving up to fifth floor of the building. We were only two in the lift and the door closed. Suddenly I was shocked to find this man falling at my feel and asking Raghuram, bless me I want to become chief engineer. I said in shock, sir, leave it. You are so senior and I am so junior what can I do! He replied, I heard people talking that you also meditate. May be you have powers to bless me! I said, oh my god what will people think if they see this, for which he said, that is why I am holding you in the lift so that no one will see us. As soon as the lift stopped in fifth floor and we came out he immediately became my boss in front of others and started asking me, Raghuram, why are you late? I was surprised! That is to show how much he was caught up in wanting to become chief engineer.As he was given to several vises, one day he became sick of jaundice and went into deep come. He was in ICU and we as colleagues were taking care of his body in coma as various machines were working around him. Even doctors also gave p hopes and we were waiting when the end will come peacefully. After nine days that evening he recovered some it of consciousness. Before death there will be sudden spark of life coming up! I was by his side and gave held his hand and in the process of giving positive feeling I said in his ears loud, sir dont worry you will become alright and once you are better we will go home. As if he heard he opened his lifeless eyes, and with feeble voice said, Raghuram, save me I want to become chief engineer! I was surprised to find that the thought has gone to such deep layers in sub-consciousness that the moment he got a bit of consciousness it surfaced. Consciousness belongs to body and sub-consciousness belongs to that part of prana namely Udana, i am sure that, this desire will definitely go with him life after life and the struggle continues!When a person looses his one of the limbs the memory of the limb happens to linger on for several days and he would be having pain or itch in that limb. It is also observed that he would be feeling like using that limb. When this can happen for a lost limb the scriptures say that even when a person looses his body, he, meaning his soul will still be around that place trying to express his self but unfortunately he does not have the body to manifest his expressions. That is the reason in the Hindu culture there are ceremonies of offering food and taking care of them to be performed for the departed persons by the people who are close to them. This will continue for twelve days with an idea by then the connection with body is slowly gone and the soul now departs finally from that vicinity. The food and other offerings may not reach the soul but the feeling of taking care by the family in Hindu thinking will certainly reach the person, the soul. So the offering is expected to be given with devotion and emotional feeling. Unfortunately the procedures are becoming these days as rituals and loosing the emotional touch.We can see how people store their deep rooted wishes and desires, angers and animosity etc, in their subtle and unconscious layers of mind that these are not going to get washed out just by leaving this body. Spiritually evolved are the people who do not have any of these bondages and so they have freedom and their souls are liberated. That is the reason our spiritual texts say that desires are our bondages so to have neither good nor bad desires. That is how we can free our Udana.</span></p>\n<p><span></span><br/><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>As I said earlier, the concept of prana has been originally given by our ancient scriptures, which makes such profound sense.

Unfortunately the procedures are becoming these days as rituals and loosing the emotional touch.We can see how people store their deep rooted wishes and desires, angers and animosity etc, in their subtle and unconscious layers of mind that these are not going to get washed out just by leaving this body. Spiritually evolved are the people who do not have any of these bondages and so they have freedom and their souls are liberated. That is the reason our spiritual texts say that desires are our bondages so to have neither good nor bad desires. That is how we can free our Udana.</span></p>  \n\n<p><span></span><br/><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Concept of Prana","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2004-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2004-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2004-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":214,"uuid":"abd0d1f1-7f4f-4d31-8d80-7d1ded506ee7","title":"Man \"sentenced\" to Yoga Lessons","slug":"man-sentenced-to-yoga-lessons","markdown":"<p><span>WASHINGTON: An American judge has introduced a new twist to the US justice system by &lsquo;sentencing&rsquo; a man convicted of spousal abuse to a yoga course instead of a prison term.

Not many people paid attention to it but it made me think with sincerity.</span><br/><span>The question is a common man has the grasp of two things; one is body and the other is mind. When one has pain or injury it is there at body level. Another thing that bothers one is worry or suffering which is there at mind level. This appears to give him answers to all his problems. Apart from these two why do we need a third aspect called prana? How can we convince somebody with the idea of prana? Excepting India the whole world developed so far for several thousands of years with out a word equivalent to prana. For a lay person who is not introduced to Indian ways of thinking, in what way can we convince him about the importance of prana?</span><br/><span>This, I found, is a very interesting question. Some of the speakers tried to answer it in their own way. Some suggested that we all have life pulsating in us. That is prana. This is alright that we have life which is prana. The objection is that we know that we have life, which is prana and we know we are living as long as there is prana in us and the moment it goes away we are no more! This truth everybody knows. Everybody knows that as long as there is prana there will be activities going on, such as, heart will be beating and respiration will be going on. There will be activity in the hands and legs, eyes, ears and in the brain. If this energy is same as the food energy that we take, then as long as we continue to give food so long we should be living. But it is not so. This prana may not be the energy that we take in the form of food, because even though we continue to take food we will not continue to live. So life energy is different from the food energy we take and food appears to be complimenting this, which is some kind of fundamental aspect called prana.</span><br/><span>I thought in another direction to convince myself to think about this prana and need to continue to work with this prana in the form of pranayama practices. Several years ago, I was invited for a satsang by a friend of mine, who is a very highly sophisticated lady, coming from an aristocratic family. She wanted to offer me a cup of tea which she wanted to make. She put half a liter of milk on the stove. When the water started boiling she transferred two cups in to another vessel and put some tea powder added milk and it has become cold. Now she once again tried to heat it and add sugar. Then she found the vessel was not proper and transferred it into another vessel and tried to stain and on and on! I told her, “Madam, I would have spent lot less energy in making two cups of tea rather than watching you make two cups of tea!”</span><br/><span>Outcome of the result being the same, one can do with less prana where as the other spends more prana. There can be such a difference in the life energy being spent by different people. This difference does not depend on the food energy that we take. A few more similar day to day life examples I can bring up here. When you look at the hand writing of some people you can notice this difference. Some people write continuously for ten pages at a stretch very legibly and beautifully and the letters you can find them to be uniform and no change in their shape and size indicating there is no energy level difference between beginning and at the end of writing for him. On the other hand many others feel completely exhausted by the time they come to the end of the page, while they are writing. This we find does not depend on the food one takes nor the training one has taken in the activity called writing.</span><br/><span>This I feel is the way prana can manifest in the form of writing. This is prana in English we can refer to it as life force, for the lack of any other word. This is certainly different from the energy that we take in the form of food!</span><br/><span>The same way when some dancers dance, it is so soft like gentle flow of breeze, where as when some dance you feel as if there is an earth quake! This difference is seen not only in dancing, but you can see it in every activity such as walking, talking, singing, playing, cooking etc. a person exhausts large amount of the life force in doing these simple activities where as some others are just fresh even after doing a large amount of work. And this difference is independent of the energy a person consumes in the form of food. This is known as prana!</span><br/><span>If the amount of prana a person puts behind an activity is constant and unchangeable, which means the amount of prana spent by one in doing certain activity is absolutely fixed like one’s finger prints, and if a person has no control or command over this prana one spends, then there is no point in discussing about it. Then the difference between the prana spent by different persons for same amount of work done is different. If it is like one person is tall and one is short and nothing can be done about it. It looks so from our experience like if one asks how to reduce amount of energy spent behind walking or behind talking we can not suggest how can that be possible. But, on the other hand, there is one function-center in our body where we can control it to some degree. That is our respiratory center. At respiratory center we can definitely but gradually create a change. If you suggest one to slow down breath rate one can make it happen. One can make the respiration soft and smooth. Voluntarily one can take deep breath and thereby achieve slow respiratory rate. A practice of this manipulating prana spent for sufficiently long periods of time can bring about a permanent change in the respiratory rate.</span><br/><span>Prana is that force behind respiratory muscles to generate and control our respiratory activity. By slowing the respiratory rate we are actually controlling the prana, breath is only consequential. Prana is responsible for all the activities with in us. In other words different activities are the manifestation of same prana through different centers such as seeing, hearing, talking, and thinking etc. slowing down the prana activity at one center. Automatically sows down at all other centers. We become cool!</span><br/><span>This can be experienced naturally. When somebody is in panic and agitated slowing and deep breathing will help him to come out of the panic situation. Prana slowed down at respiratory center slows down the activity of prana at all the other centers. That is the reason the pranayama practices are given as slowing down the speed of respiration by Patanjali.</span><br/><span>One of the important difficulties one encounters in trying to slow down respiration is monotony (not having variety) and the other difficulty is that our mind starts wandering away in all directions and as a result we loose our awareness. Once the awareness is not there we are not there any more to slow down the activity of prana. It is therefore necessary to have techniques to attach our awareness to respiration. These techniques may also have some other benefits incidentally, such as improving lung functions etc, but primarily it is to slow down prana activity.</span><br/><span>These techniques are of three categories.</span><br/><span>The first category is where the physiological details of respiratory center are used. Our lungs have three sets of muscles, namely the diaphragm muscle which separate stomach from lungs, the chest muscles which are spanning between the ribs and the third, the clavicular muscles which are associated with clavicles and shoulder blades. Respiration takes place through both the nostrils and if necessary we also use mouth for respiration. These details are utilized for the sake of pranayama practices in a nut shell. Some of these techniques are anuloma viloma pranayama, nadi-shuddhi pranayama, suryanuloma and chandranuloma pranayama, and bhastrika which fall under the first category.</span><br/><span>The second category of practices uses the temperature aspect of respiration. We can feel the temperature of the air we breathe, varying with moisture while we breathe through mouth. We can also feel warm breath while exhaling. Can we enhance this property and make it useful. These practices are Sheetali, Sheetkari, and Sadanta pranayama.</span><br/><span>The third category of practices is associated with sound. The sound that we produce while talking uses our breath. The practices are Nada-anusandhana, Bhramari etc.</span><br/><span>The essential philosophy is that the peace of mind is the purpose and goal of life. Where there is no peace there is no happiness even though we may have many other things may. Yoga by definition is the technique to calm down the mind. This peace of mind, when percolated into prana, manifests as slowness and at body level manifests as relaxation. If we have neglected this goal of life, we are deviating from the very definition of yoga. But though the goal of pranayama is to slow down the prana inside some times consciously suspending the breath with a gentle pressure can also be adapted which is known as Kumbhaka. This may be useful for removing the lethargy and dullness.</span><br/><span>In the path of spiritual progress one elevated himself above the level of physical body with the help of asanas and transcends the prana body by slowing down the prana. Further the mental body is transcended through meditation which is described in the Patanjali yoga sutras as Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.</span><br/><span>Thus the practices called pranayama are not what you do with prana, but what you do to prana so that we can transcend the bondages and disturbances at prana and we can continue our journey to subtler layers of existence.</span><br/><span>Here I have not covered the details of the technology of practices of pranayama. They are available in various pranayama texts. Let us but bear in mind one thing that techniques are all for the sake of enriching and enhancing the inner peace and harmony.</span><br/><span></span></p>\n<p><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>Namaste,</span><br/><span>One of the delegates asked a very simple but honest question in one of the conference.

Not many people paid attention to it but it made me think with sincerity.</span><br/><span>The question is a common man has the grasp of two things; one is body and the other is mind. When one has pain or injury it is there at body level. Another thing that bothers one is worry or suffering which is there at mind level. This appears to give him answers to all his problems. Apart from these two why do we need a third aspect called prana? How can we convince somebody with the idea of prana? Excepting India the whole world developed so far for several thousands of years with out a word equivalent to prana. For a lay person who is not introduced to Indian ways of thinking, in what way can we convince him about the importance of prana?</span><br/><span>This, I found, is a very interesting question. Some of the speakers tried to answer it in their own way. Some suggested that we all have life pulsating in us. That is prana. This is alright that we have life which is prana. The objection is that we know that we have life, which is prana and we know we are living as long as there is prana in us and the moment it goes away we are no more! This truth everybody knows. Everybody knows that as long as there is prana there will be activities going on, such as, heart will be beating and respiration will be going on. There will be activity in the hands and legs, eyes, ears and in the brain. If this energy is same as the food energy that we take, then as long as we continue to give food so long we should be living. But it is not so. This prana may not be the energy that we take in the form of food, because even though we continue to take food we will not continue to live. So life energy is different from the food energy we take and food appears to be complimenting this, which is some kind of fundamental aspect called prana.</span><br/><span>I thought in another direction to convince myself to think about this prana and need to continue to work with this prana in the form of pranayama practices. Several years ago, I was invited for a satsang by a friend of mine, who is a very highly sophisticated lady, coming from an aristocratic family. She wanted to offer me a cup of tea which she wanted to make. She put half a liter of milk on the stove. When the water started boiling she transferred two cups in to another vessel and put some tea powder added milk and it has become cold. Now she once again tried to heat it and add sugar. Then she found the vessel was not proper and transferred it into another vessel and tried to stain and on and on! I told her, “Madam, I would have spent lot less energy in making two cups of tea rather than watching you make two cups of tea!”</span><br/><span>Outcome of the result being the same, one can do with less prana where as the other spends more prana. There can be such a difference in the life energy being spent by different people. This difference does not depend on the food energy that we take. A few more similar day to day life examples I can bring up here. When you look at the hand writing of some people you can notice this difference. Some people write continuously for ten pages at a stretch very legibly and beautifully and the letters you can find them to be uniform and no change in their shape and size indicating there is no energy level difference between beginning and at the end of writing for him. On the other hand many others feel completely exhausted by the time they come to the end of the page, while they are writing. This we find does not depend on the food one takes nor the training one has taken in the activity called writing.</span><br/><span>This I feel is the way prana can manifest in the form of writing. This is prana in English we can refer to it as life force, for the lack of any other word. This is certainly different from the energy that we take in the form of food!</span><br/><span>The same way when some dancers dance, it is so soft like gentle flow of breeze, where as when some dance you feel as if there is an earth quake! This difference is seen not only in dancing, but you can see it in every activity such as walking, talking, singing, playing, cooking etc. a person exhausts large amount of the life force in doing these simple activities where as some others are just fresh even after doing a large amount of work. And this difference is independent of the energy a person consumes in the form of food. This is known as prana!</span><br/><span>If the amount of prana a person puts behind an activity is constant and unchangeable, which means the amount of prana spent by one in doing certain activity is absolutely fixed like one’s finger prints, and if a person has no control or command over this prana one spends, then there is no point in discussing about it. Then the difference between the prana spent by different persons for same amount of work done is different. If it is like one person is tall and one is short and nothing can be done about it. It looks so from our experience like if one asks how to reduce amount of energy spent behind walking or behind talking we can not suggest how can that be possible. But, on the other hand, there is one function-center in our body where we can control it to some degree. That is our respiratory center. At respiratory center we can definitely but gradually create a change. If you suggest one to slow down breath rate one can make it happen. One can make the respiration soft and smooth. Voluntarily one can take deep breath and thereby achieve slow respiratory rate. A practice of this manipulating prana spent for sufficiently long periods of time can bring about a permanent change in the respiratory rate.</span><br/><span>Prana is that force behind respiratory muscles to generate and control our respiratory activity. By slowing the respiratory rate we are actually controlling the prana, breath is only consequential. Prana is responsible for all the activities with in us. In other words different activities are the manifestation of same prana through different centers such as seeing, hearing, talking, and thinking etc. slowing down the prana activity at one center. Automatically sows down at all other centers. We become cool!</span><br/><span>This can be experienced naturally. When somebody is in panic and agitated slowing and deep breathing will help him to come out of the panic situation. Prana slowed down at respiratory center slows down the activity of prana at all the other centers. That is the reason the pranayama practices are given as slowing down the speed of respiration by Patanjali.</span><br/><span>One of the important difficulties one encounters in trying to slow down respiration is monotony (not having variety) and the other difficulty is that our mind starts wandering away in all directions and as a result we loose our awareness. Once the awareness is not there we are not there any more to slow down the activity of prana. It is therefore necessary to have techniques to attach our awareness to respiration. These techniques may also have some other benefits incidentally, such as improving lung functions etc, but primarily it is to slow down prana activity.</span><br/><span>These techniques are of three categories.</span><br/><span>The first category is where the physiological details of respiratory center are used. Our lungs have three sets of muscles, namely the diaphragm muscle which separate stomach from lungs, the chest muscles which are spanning between the ribs and the third, the clavicular muscles which are associated with clavicles and shoulder blades. Respiration takes place through both the nostrils and if necessary we also use mouth for respiration. These details are utilized for the sake of pranayama practices in a nut shell. Some of these techniques are anuloma viloma pranayama, nadi-shuddhi pranayama, suryanuloma and chandranuloma pranayama, and bhastrika which fall under the first category.</span><br/><span>The second category of practices uses the temperature aspect of respiration. We can feel the temperature of the air we breathe, varying with moisture while we breathe through mouth. We can also feel warm breath while exhaling. Can we enhance this property and make it useful. These practices are Sheetali, Sheetkari, and Sadanta pranayama.</span><br/><span>The third category of practices is associated with sound. The sound that we produce while talking uses our breath. The practices are Nada-anusandhana, Bhramari etc.</span><br/><span>The essential philosophy is that the peace of mind is the purpose and goal of life. Where there is no peace there is no happiness even though we may have many other things may. Yoga by definition is the technique to calm down the mind. This peace of mind, when percolated into prana, manifests as slowness and at body level manifests as relaxation. If we have neglected this goal of life, we are deviating from the very definition of yoga. But though the goal of pranayama is to slow down the prana inside some times consciously suspending the breath with a gentle pressure can also be adapted which is known as Kumbhaka. This may be useful for removing the lethargy and dullness.</span><br/><span>In the path of spiritual progress one elevated himself above the level of physical body with the help of asanas and transcends the prana body by slowing down the prana. Further the mental body is transcended through meditation which is described in the Patanjali yoga sutras as Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.</span><br/><span>Thus the practices called pranayama are not what you do with prana, but what you do to prana so that we can transcend the bondages and disturbances at prana and we can continue our journey to subtler layers of existence.</span><br/><span>Here I have not covered the details of the technology of practices of pranayama. They are available in various pranayama texts.

I felt like they are army. I was wondering why should you call the functioning of eyes as seeing, ears hearing, tongue tasting, and stomach digesting, etc why should we call sympathetic nervous system as fighting while we use fighting as a bad thing in outside world. Parasympathetic nervous system now fights with the sympathetic system.</span><br/><span>I am not a student of medicine- do not even have a basic knowledge of anatomy or physiology. But I try to feel from my heart what I come to know.</span><br/><span>Similarly when I was hearing about the theory called survival of fittest of Darwin I had similar feeling of non-acceptability because I always feel nature works in harmony. Nature does not work with an agenda if something is weak, so it should be eliminated because there is no ‘utility of it by its survival’. As if utility is the basis of creation!</span><br/><span>I would like to share some of the ideas in this regard. Not that I am very clear with the entire picture but this appears to be due to the influence of some notions which may be baseless on the theories man creates. The nature has its own way of functioning. We only label it so that we can be guided by our understanding. That influences further our thinking process.</span><br/><span>There are as I see basically two world views. One is that the world is bad and the journey in this world is full of hurdles and we need to be very careful and keep fighting all the time. We need to have this awareness and caution in order to fight and succeed, without which you are no more. We need to struggle all the time. Life is a battle field.</span><br/><span>The second view is that the creation is basically good and is from god and it is his freedom and his choice of ‘one to become many’ that He has become many in the form of various animals and birds trees and rivers sky and the beautiful clouds and all. The manifestation is a beautiful song and the living is a festivity. Every breath you take is a celebration every step you take in walking is a dance. And finally the basis of the creation the divinity hidden in the creation is the harmony which keeps the creation intact.</span><br/><span>I am comfortable with and I feel our scriptures have always taken the later view as spiritual view and that is why we have such prayers samno mitrah sam varunah etc. or saha na vavatu etc. and I was trying to find out what could be the origin of the second view of the nature namely fight is the essence of existence.</span><br/><span>When I think I feel the origin for the first way of thinking has been developed as follows.</span><br/><span>In certain parts of the world, mainly in the west, man had to constantly fight for his survival. He had to fight the nature’s vagaries such as extreme cold conditions and extreme hot conditions when he did not have the facility like what man has today or he did not have the defense system like animals have. But he is having intelligence so that he could develop his skills and technology for his safety. This same argument he brought in allhis activities and in explaining every thing he came across in the creation. In order to fight he has to first of all convince himself that it is enemy and it is bad, and given a freedom or if he slackens the whole creation, particularly the animals are there to destroy his very existence.</span><br/><span>But the reality is that the animals do not attack unless they are hungry and they find food in front of them; unless they find that their life is threatened they don’t attack. May be they sense that man is much more capable than them in terms of their intelligence so it looks like they are afraid of man much more than they are for any other creatures. Actually these days so much of research is done in the area of animal behavior. They even say that the animals are not violent just like that. They may just be playful some times.</span><br/><span>I was watching an animal channel. A tiger was lying after having a meal. A deer was grazing at a couple of feet away not noticing the tiger. The tiger just opens his eyes yarns and goes back to sleep. The commentator says that the tigers are not violent. They eat their food.</span><br/><span>Even though such kind of research shows that animals are not basically violent, we have not yet revised our opinion regarding human being who is supposed to have evolved from animal and the human being continues to be violent. Violence is not his basic nature because even the primary assumption that animals are violent appears to be wrong.</span><br/><span>First of all it is assumed that the fighting is or aggression is the essence of creation, and several aspects of creation are explained based on this aspect of aggression. Recently my friend in Germany said that they are taught from the childhood this concept, ‘Homino homini lupus’ which basically means, he explained, man is a wolf for another man. It means man is always waiting for an opportunity how to cheat how to deceive and how to destroy another human being. Wolf is believed to be an animal not only just kills but it is very violent and destroys its pray. In other words man is a pray for another man. This means man is there to destroy the success or existence of the other man. This is mirroring the idea that animals are violent and so is man. Now when you look at how all the other ideas emerge out of it. When you question why man is like a wolf, the answer arbitrarily given I think is, because man is originally a sinner. Therefore the concept that man is a sinner is to justify the original idea that man is wolf of another man. So a strong man subdues a weak man!</span><br/><span>The same theory has been applied to all other creatures as follows. It is not only man but the whole creation is like this. That is why it is hypothesized that a strong animal tries to destroy the survival of the weak animal so the law of creation is ‘survival of the fittest’. To what extent the fight is going on or when it is going on? The answer is it is going on in the creation all the time. Taking the same clue the activity going on in our body is also explained in the same way. In our body we are fighting all the time in the form of the sympathetic nervous system fighting the external aggression. Fighting is a way of life.</span><br/><span>Extending this concept of violence to the work place the work that you do in the office is also psychologically explained as fight. That is why the work place is like a battle field. The whole market is a big company has to eat up the weak company. The big industry has to wipe away he weak industry, which in sophisticated language we call as expansion or merger. Where we can get more for less we are smart and intelligent. It is not only in our own country but in the countries where the labor is cheap go there and exploit them. That is why these days the cry called the out sourcing. Working even at the individual level is like a fight and we need the respite from this fight. That is why we need a vacation from the work. You can see the expression on the faces of the people who go to the work, which it is some thing unwanted, like.</span><br/><span>When the society believed in the theory that every body is a wolf of other, then naturally every one is fighting with the other and every one is looking for his pound of flesh. In such a society what the man required is the simple law of mutual survival. In order to prevent or reduce the exploitation, laws are created, rights are fixed. This is your right and this is his right. Nobody should violate other’s rights. Father has a right mother has a right- child has a right adult has a right. Adults’ rights aremuch wider so every child wants to become an adult as early as possible. People are given rights and rulers have rights.</span><br/><span>Things like love your neighbor, don’t steal other’s wealth etc were good enough for people to be so called spiritual. So the spiritual laws were mainly the laws of being good and doing good. Therefore the message of being good has been the core message of spirituality.</span><br/><span>On the other hand a society and culture which is totally wedded to the idea that the creation is from god and it is his play and basically man is good and only we need to remind him, these people have a different approach in life. These people worked in trust of other and also trust about the other creatures on the earth. Aggression was not necessary in life. Being good is an ordinary thing!</span><br/><span>The first view point namely that we need to fight and survive there is a very strong ego in it and it has to be nurtured. In order to fight we need ego and stronger the ego greater you are. The character of the ego has beenonly in the form of violence. It is this ego which says that the whole world is created by god for his enjoyment. He has every right to plunder with this creation!</span><br/><span>One who has no ego can not be considered as successful. Ego is not only of the things what you have, such as beauty or wealth, intelligence or knack, smartness or aggression, these things not only we have to have it but we need to exhibit too, we need to let others know about it. To project it alsois very important, to advertise becomes very important. There is not only no value for humility but it is actively condemned. Ego is the achievements of out side and it looks like we depend up on more and more outside because we have less and less inside. We have nothing realized inside so we tend to look out side.</span><br/><span>Showing off the supremacy over other creatures has been recreation and pass time. That is the way the bull fight, WWF or similar things have significance. For a mind which does not see point in this kind of philosophy, these fights look as very barbaric and sinful. One wonders how these things can be enjoyed or why such things are not considered as crime.</span><br/><span>We also meddle with the creation for our advantage. Keeping the chicken in closed cages and putting powerful lights day and night so that they do not sleep and in turn they give more eggs or pushing the animals mercilessly through the slaughter houses can not fit in any stretch of imagination as the leaders of creation which we claim to be!</span><br/><span>This violence has percolated in every aspect. Even yoga is practiced as fighting with the body. All the definition of the asana given by the scriptures and all the definitions of yoga are kept aside because they do not satisfy this basic aspect of violence. So these days even yoga is practiced with no mercy on the body. Even if you have mercy on your body the teacher will not have. There are such quotes ‘no pain no gain’.</span><br/><span>Fasting was suggested as a wonderful spiritual practice by our ancient scriptures. It is not to punish the body or to be violent with the body but essentially to develop the control over the mind which is following the vasana forces. But today even the fasting is like punishing the body and the gentleness is disappearing in the so called spiritual aspirants. Bhakti-way of looking which means looking with love and compassion and having an attitude of pardoning has been replaced by policing and fault-finding.</span><br/><span>True Indian philosophy has nothing in the form of violence. Every thing is to enhance or manifest the harmony or divinity. Our medicine is not to fight the disease but to help health. Practice of asanas is a way of satisfying the body so that body will be peaceful. Satvic or right kind of food is thatfood that doesn’t leave body fighting with the food. Fasting is also to fight or punish the body. It is a way to give rest to the body or to give such training to the body that body will learn to slowly develop satisfaction with any kind of or no food. It is again and again emphasized that if you develop no aggression inside you will be able to manifest aggression outside also. What is there inside comes out from us and we manifest that quality. That is why this society is never a conqueror yet survived ten thousand years if not more and is still vibrant! It is in this culture where the lord Krishna advises Pandavas, who were extremely good yet, face all kinds of hardships that they should not invite fight or war but when war comes they should not hesitate! Here is the case where even war is used for the sake of peace! This is a culture to please fathers desire son leaves kingdom and goes to the forest, or son gives up marriage including the kingship and serves the kingdom. There are cultures where one after the other son killed his father to occupy the kingdom! That fits very clearly the concept ‘survival of the fittest’.</span></p>\n<p><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","html":"<p><span>First time when I heard that our sympathetic nervous system fights with the enemies on our body I felt uncomfortable.

Therefore the concept that man is a sinner is to justify the original idea that man is wolf of another man. So a strong man subdues a weak man!</span><br/><span>The same theory has been applied to all other creatures as follows. It is not only man but the whole creation is like this. That is why it is hypothesized that a strong animal tries to destroy the survival of the weak animal so the law of creation is ‘survival of the fittest’. To what extent the fight is going on or when it is going on? The answer is it is going on in the creation all the time. Taking the same clue the activity going on in our body is also explained in the same way. In our body we are fighting all the time in the form of the sympathetic nervous system fighting the external aggression. Fighting is a way of life.</span><br/><span>Extending this concept of violence to the work place the work that you do in the office is also psychologically explained as fight. That is why the work place is like a battle field. The whole market is a big company has to eat up the weak company. The big industry has to wipe away he weak industry, which in sophisticated language we call as expansion or merger. Where we can get more for less we are smart and intelligent. It is not only in our own country but in the countries where the labor is cheap go there and exploit them. That is why these days the cry called the out sourcing. Working even at the individual level is like a fight and we need the respite from this fight. That is why we need a vacation from the work. You can see the expression on the faces of the people who go to the work, which it is some thing unwanted, like.</span><br/><span>When the society believed in the theory that every body is a wolf of other, then naturally every one is fighting with the other and every one is looking for his pound of flesh. In such a society what the man required is the simple law of mutual survival. In order to prevent or reduce the exploitation, laws are created, rights are fixed. This is your right and this is his right. Nobody should violate other’s rights. Father has a right mother has a right- child has a right adult has a right. Adults’ rights aremuch wider so every child wants to become an adult as early as possible. People are given rights and rulers have rights.</span><br/><span>Things like love your neighbor, don’t steal other’s wealth etc were good enough for people to be so called spiritual. So the spiritual laws were mainly the laws of being good and doing good. Therefore the message of being good has been the core message of spirituality.</span><br/><span>On the other hand a society and culture which is totally wedded to the idea that the creation is from god and it is his play and basically man is good and only we need to remind him, these people have a different approach in life. These people worked in trust of other and also trust about the other creatures on the earth. Aggression was not necessary in life. Being good is an ordinary thing!</span><br/><span>The first view point namely that we need to fight and survive there is a very strong ego in it and it has to be nurtured. In order to fight we need ego and stronger the ego greater you are. The character of the ego has beenonly in the form of violence. It is this ego which says that the whole world is created by god for his enjoyment. He has every right to plunder with this creation!</span><br/><span>One who has no ego can not be considered as successful. Ego is not only of the things what you have, such as beauty or wealth, intelligence or knack, smartness or aggression, these things not only we have to have it but we need to exhibit too, we need to let others know about it. To project it alsois very important, to advertise becomes very important. There is not only no value for humility but it is actively condemned. Ego is the achievements of out side and it looks like we depend up on more and more outside because we have less and less inside. We have nothing realized inside so we tend to look out side.</span><br/><span>Showing off the supremacy over other creatures has been recreation and pass time. That is the way the bull fight, WWF or similar things have significance. For a mind which does not see point in this kind of philosophy, these fights look as very barbaric and sinful. One wonders how these things can be enjoyed or why such things are not considered as crime.</span><br/><span>We also meddle with the creation for our advantage. Keeping the chicken in closed cages and putting powerful lights day and night so that they do not sleep and in turn they give more eggs or pushing the animals mercilessly through the slaughter houses can not fit in any stretch of imagination as the leaders of creation which we claim to be!</span><br/><span>This violence has percolated in every aspect. Even yoga is practiced as fighting with the body. All the definition of the asana given by the scriptures and all the definitions of yoga are kept aside because they do not satisfy this basic aspect of violence. So these days even yoga is practiced with no mercy on the body. Even if you have mercy on your body the teacher will not have. There are such quotes ‘no pain no gain’.</span><br/><span>Fasting was suggested as a wonderful spiritual practice by our ancient scriptures. It is not to punish the body or to be violent with the body but essentially to develop the control over the mind which is following the vasana forces. But today even the fasting is like punishing the body and the gentleness is disappearing in the so called spiritual aspirants. Bhakti-way of looking which means looking with love and compassion and having an attitude of pardoning has been replaced by policing and fault-finding.</span><br/><span>True Indian philosophy has nothing in the form of violence. Every thing is to enhance or manifest the harmony or divinity. Our medicine is not to fight the disease but to help health. Practice of asanas is a way of satisfying the body so that body will be peaceful. Satvic or right kind of food is thatfood that doesn’t leave body fighting with the food. Fasting is also to fight or punish the body. It is a way to give rest to the body or to give such training to the body that body will learn to slowly develop satisfaction with any kind of or no food. It is again and again emphasized that if you develop no aggression inside you will be able to manifest aggression outside also. What is there inside comes out from us and we manifest that quality. That is why this society is never a conqueror yet survived ten thousand years if not more and is still vibrant! It is in this culture where the lord Krishna advises Pandavas, who were extremely good yet, face all kinds of hardships that they should not invite fight or war but when war comes they should not hesitate! Here is the case where even war is used for the sake of peace! This is a culture to please fathers desire son leaves kingdom and goes to the forest, or son gives up marriage including the kingship and serves the kingdom. There are cultures where one after the other son killed his father to occupy the kingdom! That fits very clearly the concept ‘survival of the fittest’.</span></p>  \n\n<p><span>Love</span><br/><span>N.V.Raghuram</span></p>","image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Influence of thought on our thinking","meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2003-12-24T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2003-12-24T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2003-12-24T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1}],"posts_tags":[{"id":1,"post_id":1,"tag_id":1}],"app_settings":[]}}]}
